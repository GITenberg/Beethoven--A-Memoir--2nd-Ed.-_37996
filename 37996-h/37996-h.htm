<h3>PREFACE<br /></h3>

<p>The following brief sketch can lay no claim to originality; it is
merely a slight <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> of the principal events in the
master's life (from the works of Schindler, Ries, and Wegeler, and
more especially from Marx and Thayer), and is intended for those who,
without the leisure to go deeply into the subject, yet desire to know
a little more about the great Tone-poet than can be gathered from the
pages of a concert programme, however skilfully annotated.</p>

<p>The few letters introduced have been translated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>as nearly as possible in the manner in
which they were written. Beethoven's epistolary style was simple, fervent, original, but
certainly not polished.</p>

<p>The author feels convinced that any shortcomings
in the "Memoir" will be more than
atoned for by Dr. Hiller's eloquent and appreciative
"<i>Festrede</i>," which seems to have been
dictated by that poetic genius, the possession
of which he so modestly disclaims.</p>

<h3>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION</h3>


<p>The first edition of this little book was exhausted
within a few months of publication, and I have
repeatedly been asked since to reprint it, but have
hitherto withheld my consent, trusting to be able
to undertake a more comprehensive work on the
subject. As, however, the necessary leisure for this
is still wanting to me, and the demand for the
"Memoir" continues, it is fated to reappear, and
I can but commend it again to the kind indulgence
of the reader.</p>

<p>Several rectifications as to dates, &amp;c., have been
made throughout, in accordance with the recent
researches of <span class="smcap">Alexander Thayer</span>, and the
chapter entitled <i>Lehrjahre</i> has been partly rewritten
on the basis of <span class="smcap">Nottebohm's</span> <i>Beethoven's Studien</i>
(<i>Part I., Unterricht bei Haydn und Albrechtsberger</i>)
by far the most important contribution to Beethoven-literature
which has appeared for some time. It
may, indeed, be considered the first step to the
<i>systematic</i> study of the Master, and as such deserves
to be better known in England than is at present
the case.</p>

<h3>THE HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY OF BEETHOVEN'S BIRTH<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor"><span style="font-size:.8em;">[1]</span></a></h3>

<p style="margin-left:35em;">"<i>Quasi Fantasia.</i>"<br /></p>


<p>The year 1749 brought us Goethe; 1756, Mozart;
1759, Schiller; and 1770, Beethoven. Thus, within
the short space of twenty-one years four of the
greatest poetic geniuses were born&mdash;four men of
whom not only the German Fatherland, but all
mankind must be proud.</p>

<p>And even more happy than proud, since the most
splendid gift which the Divine Being from time to
time vouchsafes to poor humanity is that of genius.
Through it we receive the highest good in which we
are capable of participating&mdash;the forgetfulness of self
in a nobler life. Genius it is that gives us, if but for
a few short hours, that which the believer awaits with
earnest hope in another and a better world.</p>

<p>Has there ever existed a poet who transported our
souls into his ideal kingdom with more irresistible
force than our Beethoven? Certainly not. More
universal effects have been achieved by others, but
none more deep or noble. Nay, we may say without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
exaggeration that never did an artist live whose
creations were so truly <i>new</i>;&mdash;his sphere was the
unforeseen.</p>

<p>Amidst so much that is trivial and dispiriting in art
and life, the widely diffused interest, the delight in
the creations of the wondrous man is a bright sign of
our times. I do not say the <i>comprehension</i> of them;
that is not, and cannot be the case. But there are,
perhaps, no poems in the love and admiration of
which so many of the highest intellects concur as the
tone-poems of our master. To the essential nature
of our Art, which bears within itself the all-reconciling
element of love, must we attribute the fact that
against it the most violent differences in religious,
political, and philosophical opinion make no stand&mdash;it
is the might of Beethoven's genius which subdues
the proudest minds, while quickening the pulsations
of the simplest hearts.</p>

<p>If in anything the will of man shows itself weak,
nay, helpless, it is in the matter of intellectual creation.
A very strong will (is not even this beyond the reach
of most?) may lead to great learning, to brilliant
technical acquirements, to virtue itself&mdash;a spontaneous
poetic thought in word, tone, or colour, it will never
be able to bring forth. Thus, the true relation of
genius to us is that of a star, diffusing light and
warmth, which we enjoy and admire. Since, however,
to the higher man recognition and gratitude are
necessities, since he desires to add intelligence and
reverence to his admiration, and would willingly offer
up love also to the subject of it, he begins to investi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>gate.
He asks, what the divine germ, existing even in
the lisping child, demanded for its development; what
brought it out into blossom&mdash;what influences worked
upon it beneficially&mdash;to what extent he who was so
nobly gifted was supported and furthered by moral
strength&mdash;how he used the talent committed to him&mdash;finally,
how he fought through the life-struggle from
which no mortal is exempt.</p>

<p>And then he inquires again and further; which of
his qualities, which of the properties peculiar to himself,
affect us most strongly?&mdash;in what relation does
he stand to the development of his art&mdash;in what to
that of his nation?&mdash;how does he appear with regard
to his own century?</p>

<p>A mere attempt at answering these questions, and
the many connected with them, would require an
enormous apparatus of a biographic and &aelig;sthetic
nature, including a knowledge of the history of art
and culture, and an acquaintance with musical technicalities.
It does not fall either within our power or
the scope of these pages to make any approach to
such a task. A few slight hints may suffice to prevent
our forgetting (amid the extraordinary and all-engrossing
occurrences of the present time) the day
which sent to us a hundred years ago the no less
extraordinary man, who, a prophet in the noblest
sense of the word, foresaw and declared (though only
in tones) the nobleness and greatness which will be
revealed by the German people, if friendly stars shine
upon their future.</p>

<p>A species of caste seems to have been implanted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
in man by nature&mdash;there are families of statesmen,
warriors, theologians, artists. It will nevertheless be
admitted that while it is often the case that circumstances,
family traditions, cause the sons to follow in
their fathers' footsteps, it frequently happens that the
calling lays hold of the man, becomes, in the truest
sense of the word, a <i>calling</i>.</p>

<p>Several of our first composers have sprung out of
families in which the profession of music was chiefly
followed&mdash;but certainly not many. One thing, however,
was common to nearly all&mdash;they were marvellous
children, prodigies. <i>Prodigy!</i> now-a-days an
ominous word, recalling immediately to mind industrious
fathers, who force on concerts, and musical
attainments which do not refresh by their maturity,
but only excite astonishment at the precocity of
those from whom they are exacted. The abuse of
the phenomenon has brought the latter itself into a
bad light. A musical hothouse plant forced into
premature bloom through vanity or the thirst for
money may soon become stunted; none the less,
however, does the fact remain, that no intellectual
gift shows or develops itself earlier than that of
music. Bach, Handel, Mozart, Hummel, Rossini,
Mendelssohn, Clara Schumann, Liszt, Joachim, were
prodigies. Nature knows what she is about. He
alone to whom this wondrous tone-language has become
a second mother tongue, will be able to express
himself with freedom in it; but how soon do we
begin to attempt our mother tongue! And how few
succeed in really learning to <i>speak</i> it!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span></p>

<p>It would be inexplicable had not our Beethoven
been also a prodigy. He was one, but after such a
sound, healthy sort, that those about him were more
struck by the thought of his great future, than enthusiastic
about his achievements at the time. The
compositions which have been preserved to us from
his boyish days bear traces, even then, of the frank,
honest mode of expression which remained his to
the end of his career. Naturally, their contents are
trifling; what has a boy of twelve years to communicate
to the world, if his inner life develop itself
according to nature? Borne onwards by his artistic
readiness, he attained, however, at a very early age
an honourable, independent position with regard to the
outer world. He had barely quitted childhood when
he was organist at the Elector's Court in Bonn. At
a later period he occupied for several years the post
of violist in the orchestra. The viola was then one of
the most neglected orchestral instruments, and we
must form but a slight estimate of Beethoven's
achievements upon it. It was, however, invaluable
for him, the future Commander of the instrumental
tone-world, to have served <i>in the line</i>. In fact, every
striving young composer ought, as a matter of duty,
to act for at least one year as member of an orchestra,
were it only at the great drum. It is the surest
method of making the individuality of the different
sound organs ineffaceably one's own. When the
latter are entrusted to capable executants (as was the
case in the Electoral orchestra), the idea of a definite
personality is added to the peculiarity of the instru<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>ment,
which is not at all a bad thing. How often in
later years may the image of one or other of his
former colleagues have presented itself vividly and
helpfully to the mind of the master, as he sat meditating
over a score! How often may he have heard
in spirit an expressive solo performed by one of
them!</p>

<p>The stimulus which Beethoven received from
singers in those early days at Bonn did not work
very deeply. His own father, indeed, was one of the
Elector's vocalists, and sang both in church and on
the stage. But he was a sorry fellow, who saw in his
gifted son only a means of extricating himself from
his gloomy pecuniary difficulties, and certainly not
the man to inspire him for the wedding of Word to
Tone&mdash;the noblest union ever contracted.</p>

<p>Even in the most magnificent of Beethoven's vocal
works there exists a certain roughness; the words
domineer over the melody, or the latter over the
poem. That perfect union&mdash;that melting in one
another of both factors&mdash;which is peculiar to Mozart
and Handel is found only separately (<i>vereinzelt</i>) in
him. Would a youth spent in the midst of a great
song-world have led our master along other paths?</p>

<p>Certainly not without significance for his development
was the fact, that he was born on the lovely
banks of our joyous old Rhine. Do we not sometimes
hear it surging like a wave of the mighty
stream through the Beethoven harmonies? Do we
not feel ourselves blown upon by the fresh mountain
air? And do not the cordial, true-hearted melodies,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
which so often escape from the master, breathe the
very magic of one of those enchanting evenings
which we talk or dream away on the shore of the
most truly <i>German</i> stream? The taste for an open-air
life (a life <i>im Freien</i>, in freeness, as the German
language so nobly expresses it) remained faithful to
him until the end; and we can scarcely picture him
to ourselves better than as wandering in forests and
valleys, listening for the springs which sparkled within
himself.</p>

<p>Scientific knowledge, even in its most elementary
form, was hardly presented to the notice of the young
musician, and if at a later period any interest in such
pursuits had arisen within him, he would have been
obliged to dismiss it. On the other hand, he buried himself
with his whole soul in the loftiest works of poetry,
that second higher world, and always came back with
renewed delight upon the works of Homer, Shakspere,
Goethe, and Schiller. Many and varied were the influences
which they exerted upon him. They were to him
"intellectual wine," as Bettina once named his music.
But those are completely mistaken who expect to
find, either in them or anywhere else, positive expositions
or elucidations of Beethoven's compositions,
as some have occasionally attempted to do, building
their theory partly on utterances of the master.
When the latter refers the constantly inquiring secretary,
Schindler (I know not on what occasion), to
Shakspere's "Tempest," it was, after all, only an
answer&mdash;nothing more. The awakening of pure
musical imagination is just as inexplicable as are its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
results. One thing alone stands firm,&mdash;that which
speaks to the heart, came from the heart,&mdash;but the
life-blood which pulsates at the heart of the true
artist is a thousand times more richly composed than
that which flows in our veins. No &aelig;sthetic physiologist
will ever be able to analyze it completely. And,
in life, is it only the deep thoughts, the extraordinary
occurrences, which call forth all our sensations, out of
which alone our happiness and our misery are formed?
Is not a calm, serene autumn day enough to entrance
our inmost nature? a single verse to console us? the
friendly glance of a maiden to throw us into the sweetest
<i>reverie</i>? What trifling influences affect the eternally
rising and falling quicksilver of our hopes! And
thus the smallest occasions may have been sufficient
to cause vibration in a soul so highly strung as Beethoven's.
Most powerfully, however, in such a genius,
worked the pure creative impulse, that eternally glowing
fire in the deepest recesses of his nature, with its
volcanic&mdash;but, in this instance, blissful eruptions.</p>

<p>We know that Beethoven proceeded as a young
man to Vienna, which he never afterwards left. He
found there (at least in the first half of his residence)
enthusiastic admirers, intelligent friends, admission to
distinguished circles, and lastly, that most necessary
evil&mdash;money. Nobody will grudge to the lively, good-humoured,
imperial city the fame of being able to
designate as her own a brilliant line of our greatest
tone-poets. But then she ought not to take it amiss
that we should wonder how, within her walls, at <i>that</i>
time, so magnificent an artistic development as Beet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>hoven's
should ever have been accomplished. Shall
we say, not <i>because</i>, but&mdash;<i>in spite of</i> her? or shall we
utter the supposition that no agglomeration of men
can be sufficient for genius, since it treads a way of
its own, which bears no names of streets? When,
however, the question comes under discussion, of the
relation of a great composer to <i>that</i> public among
whom his lot is cast, we cannot deny that it is easier
to understand how a Handel created his oratorios in
the so-called unmusical London, than how Beethoven
composed his symphonies in the musical Vienna of
the period. The former found himself in London in
the midst of a grand public life,&mdash;grand were the
powers over which he held sway, like the continually
increasing throngs of listeners who streamed to his
performances. When, on the other hand, we hear of
the difficulty with which Beethoven, during the course
of a quarter of a century, succeeded in giving about a
dozen concerts in which his Titanic orchestral poems
were performed <i>for the first time</i>, we become faint at
heart. And I cannot do otherwise than express my
conviction that, under other conditions, no inconsiderable
portion of his works, which are (to use Schumann's
expression) <i>veiled symphonies</i>, would have
revealed their true nature. The world of the musician
would hardly have been more enriched thereby,
but the musical public would have benefited. For
millions would have been edified, where now hundreds
torment themselves (with quartets and sonatas) for
the most part in vain.</p>

<p>Yes! these symphonies and overtures, with their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
unpretending designations, are the first poems of our
time, and they are <i>national poems</i> in a far truer sense
than the songs of the Edda, and all connected with
them, ever can or will be for us, despite the efforts of
litt&eacute;rateurs and artists. Yes! in the soul of this
Rhinelander, who every day inveighed against the
town and the state in which he lived, who was
zealous for the French Republic, and ready to
become Kapellmeister to King Jerome&mdash;in this soul
was condensed the most ideal Germania ever conceived
by the noblest mind. With the poet we may
exclaim, "For he was ours!"&mdash;<i>ours</i> through what
he uttered&mdash;<i>ours</i> through the form in which he spoke&mdash;<i>ours</i>,
for we were true to the proverb in the way
we ill-treated and misunderstood him.</p>

<p>"Industry and love" Goethe claims for his countrymen.
No artist ever exercised these qualities
with regard to his art in a higher degree than did
Beethoven. <i>She</i> was to him the highest good&mdash;no
care, no joy of life could separate him from her.
Neither riches nor honours estranged him from the
ideal which he perceived and strove after so long as
he breathed. He never could do enough to satisfy
himself either in single works or in his whole career.
He spared himself no trouble in order to work out
his thoughts to the fullest maturity, to the most
transparent clearness. To the smallest tone-picture
he brought the fullest power. His first sketches,
like the autographs of his scores, show in the plainest
manner that inflexible persistency, that unwearied
patience, which we presuppose in the scientific in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>vestigator,
but which, in the inspired singer, fill us
with astonishment and admiration. In all conflicts
(and every artistic creation is a conflict) the toughest
difficulty is <i>to persevere</i>.</p>

<p>Truth was a fundamental part of Beethoven's character.
What he sang came from his deepest soul.
Never did he allow himself to make concessions
either to the multitude and its frivolity, or to please
the vanity of executants. The courage which is
bound up with this resembles the modest bravery of
the citizen, but it celebrates even fewer triumphs
than the latter.</p>

<p>Beethoven was proud, not vain. He had the consciousness
of his intellectual power&mdash;he rejoiced to
see it recognised&mdash;but he despised the small change
of every-day applause. Suspicious and hasty, he
gave his friends occasion for many complaints, but
nowhere do we find a trace of any pretension to hero-worship.
He stood too high to feel himself honoured
by such proceedings; but, at the same time, he had
too much regard for the independent manliness of
others to be pleased with a homage which clashed
against that.</p>

<p>What a fulness of the noblest, the sublimest conceptions
must have lived and moved in him to admit
of their crystallizing themselves into the melodies
which transport us!&mdash;softness without weakness,
enthusiasm without hollowness, longing without sentimentality,
passion without madness. He is deep
but never turgid, pleasant but never insipid, lofty
but never bombastic. In the expression of love, fer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>vent,
tender, overflowing with happiness or with
melancholy, but never with ignoble sensuality. He
can be cordial, cheerful, joyful to extravagance, to
excess&mdash;never to vulgarity. In the deepest suffering
he does not lose himself&mdash;he triumphs over it. He
has been called humorous&mdash;it is a question whether
music, viewed in its immediateness and truth, be
capable of expressing humour&mdash;yet it may be that
he sometimes "smiles amid tears." With true
majesty does he move in his power, in his loftiness,
in the boldness of his action, which may rise to defiance&mdash;never
to senseless licence. A little self-will
shows itself here and there, but it suits him well, for
it is not the self-will of obstinacy, but of striving.
He can be pious, never hypocritical; his lofty soul
rises to the Unspeakable; he falls on his knees with
humility, but not with slavish fear, for he feels the
divinity within. A trace of heroic freedom pervades
all his creations, consequently they work in the cause
of freedom. The expression, "<i>Im Freien</i>"&mdash;liberty!
might serve as the inscription on a temple dedicated
to his genius!</p>

<p>Like Nature herself, he is varied in his forms, without
ever relinquishing a deep-laid, well-concerted
basis; he is rich in the melodies which he produces,
but never lavish; he acts in regard to them with
a wise economy. In the working out of his thoughts
he unites the soundest musical logic to the richest
inventive boldness. Seldom only does he forget the
words of Schiller,&mdash;"In what he leaves <i>unsaid</i>, I
discover the master of style."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span></p>

<p>This wise economy does not forsake him either in
the selection or the number of the organs which he
employs. He avoids every superfluity, but the spirits
of sound which he invokes must obey him. Nevertheless,
not to slavish servitude does he reduce them;
on the contrary, he raises them in their own estimation
by that which he exacts from them. What
might be urged against him, perhaps, is that he
sometimes makes demands upon them to which they
are not adequate, that his ideal conception goes
beyond their power of execution.</p>

<p>He has spoken almost exclusively in the highest
forms of instrumental music, and where, in one way
or other, words are added to these, he has always
been actuated by high motive. He sings of Love
and Freedom with Goethe, of Joy with Schiller, of
the heroism of Conjugal Love in "Fidelio;" in his
solemn Mass he gives expression to all those feelings
which force their way from man to his Maker.</p>

<p>Enough, enough! we would never have done, were
we to say all that could be said about such a mind.
Dare we now really claim his creations, which breathe
the highest humanity, as specially <i>German</i>? I think
this will be granted us when we add to it the consideration
that our greatest poets and thinkers have,
in like manner; struck root firmly in their nationality,
whence they have grown up&mdash;away, beyond&mdash;into
those regions from which their glance embraced but
<i>one</i> nobly striving human family.</p>

<p>It has been often declared that we, for long, felt
and recognised our national unity only through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>
the works of our poets, artists, and philosophers;
but it has never been fully recognised that it was
our first tone-poets in particular, who caused the
essential German character to be appreciated by
other nations. There are, perhaps, no two German
names which can rejoice in a popularity&mdash;widely
diffused in the most dissimilar nations&mdash;equal to
that of Mozart and Beethoven. And Haydn, and
Weber, and Schubert, and Mendelssohn! what a
propaganda have they made for the Fatherland!
That they speak a <i>universal</i> language does not prevent
their uttering in it the best which we possess
<i>as Germans</i>.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as men are constituted, it is not to
be denied that what enchants does not on that
account overawe them; they <i>esteem</i> the beautiful,
they <i>respect</i> only force and strength, even should
these work destroyingly.</p>

<p>Well, then! Germany has now shown what she
can do in this way; she will bloom afresh, and
follow out her high aims in every direction. The
consideration which we could long since have claimed
as a people, will then be freely accorded to the
German state.</p>

<p>As a musician, I can wish for the nation nothing
better than that it should resemble a Beethoven
symphony,&mdash;full of poetry and power; indivisible,
yet many-sided; rich in thought and symmetrical
in form; exalted and mighty!</p>

<p>And for the Beethoven symphonies I could wish
directors and executants like those of whom the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span>
world's history will speak when considering the
nineteenth century. But History, if at all true to her
task, must also preserve the name of the man who,
nearly seventy years ago, created the Eroica,&mdash;an
achievement in the intellectual life which may place
itself boldly by the side of every battle which has
left invigorating and formative traces on the destiny
of mankind.</p>

</div>
<p>owards the middle of the seventeenth
century there lived in a Belgian village
near Louvain a family of the name <span class="smcap">Van
Beethoven</span>. To their position in life we have no
clue, unless it be that contained in the name itself
(<i>beet</i>, root; <i>hof</i>, garden), which after all only indicates
that the occupation of some remote progenitor was
akin to that of the "grand old gardener" from whom
we all claim descent. The question, however, is
immaterial.</p>

<p>A member of this family left his native place, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
in the year 1650 settled in Antwerp, where he married,
and became the founder of a race, one of whom
was destined to render the hitherto obscure name
immortal.</p>

<p>The grandson of this Beethoven had twelve children,
the third of whom, Ludwig, followed the
example of his great-grandsire, and quitted the
paternal roof at an early age. It has been imagined
that this step was the result of family disagreements;
however that may be, it is certain that after the
lapse of some years Ludwig was again in friendly
correspondence with his relations.</p>

<p>The youth bent his steps towards the home of
his ancestors, where he probably had connections,
and succeeded in getting an appointment for the
period of three months in one of the churches of
Louvain. As this was merely to fill the place of
the <i>Phonascus</i> who was ill, young Beethoven found
himself when the three months were over again adrift.</p>

<p>He was but eighteen; tolerably well educated,
however; a cultivated musician, and the possessor of
a good voice. With these qualities he was pretty
sure of making his way, and in the following year
we hear of him at Bonn, the seat of government of
the splendour-loving Clemens August, Elector of
Cologne.</p>

<p>It has been thought that he received a special summons
thither, but this is, to say the least, doubtful.
It is more probable that the young man, with the
love of change and the confidence in his own abilities
natural to his age, was drawn to Bonn by the dazzling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
reports that were spread far and wide of the M&aelig;cenas
then on the episcopal throne.</p>

<p>A few words may not be out of place here as to
the nature of the independent Ecclesiastical States
(and specially of Cologne), which occupy so large a
space in the history of Germany prior to the French
Revolution; since the fact of the great master having
been born in one of these communities had an influence
on his career which would have been wanting
had fate placed him in a state of more importance,
politically speaking.</p>

<p>We in England are inclined to hold somewhat in
contempt the petty German court&mdash;the "Pumpernickel"
of Thackeray,&mdash;with its formality, its gossip,
its countless rules of etiquette, and its aping the doings
of its greater neighbours. And yet in this ridicule
there is a touch of ingratitude, for how greatly are
we indebted to these "Serene Transparencies," and
their love of pomp and display! How many masterpieces
of art owe to their fostering care their very
existence! How many men eminent in science and
literature have to thank them for that support and
encouragement without which their works, if produced
at all, must have fallen to the ground dead-born!
People talk of the divine power, the inherent energy
of genius, but what a loss is it for the world when
that energy is consumed in the effort of keeping soul
and body together! The divine power will and
does manifest itself at length, but enfeebled and
distorted by the struggle which might have been
averted by a little timely aid.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>These prince-bishops of Cologne generally belonged
to some royal house, the office being in fact regarded
as a convenient sinecure for younger sons. They
were chosen by the Chapter, subject only to the
approval of the Pope and the Emperor, as the supreme
spiritual and temporal heads, the people themselves
having no voice in the matter.</p>

<p>They ruled over a small territory of about thirty
German miles in length, and in some places only
two or three in breadth. Within this limited area
there were several wealthy and flourishing towns;
among which, strangely enough, that which gave its
name to the diocese was not included, a feud of the
thirteenth century between the reigning archbishop
and the burghers of Cologne having resulted in the
recognition of the latter as a free imperial city, and
the removal of the court to Bonn, which continued to
be the seat of government until the abolition of the
Electorate in 1794.</p>

<p>Were it not that the loss of so wealthy a town as
Cologne was of no small moment to the episcopal
coffers, the change must have been agreeable rather
than otherwise, for Bonn, even in those days, fairly
bore the palm from Cologne as a place of residence.
Here, then, for about five hundred years, the little
state flourished, better perhaps than we, with our
modern ideas as to the union of the temporal and
spiritual power are willing to admit, and especially
in the last fifty years of its existence, was this the case.</p>

<p>Debarred by the limited income at their disposal
from taking any prominent part in political life, cut<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
off from ordinary domestic ties and interests, the
archbishops were driven to seek compensation for
these deprivations in some favourite pursuit; and to
their credit be it said, not the delights of the chase
or the table alone engaged their attention. The old
genius of appreciation of art transferred its presence
from the Arno to the Rhine, and began to exert in
the Electors of Cologne an influence of great importance
in the &aelig;sthetic development of Germany.</p>

<p>The four last Electors especially distinguished
themselves, and shed a lustre on their court, by the
number of talented men they drew around them, and
the liberal patronage they bestowed on music and
the drama. Joseph Clemens, the first of these, was
himself a composer, after the usual fashion of royal
dilettanti, no doubt, but a keen discerner of talent
in others.</p>

<p>His successor, Clemens August, had passed his
youth in Rome, where, although modern taste was
on the decline, the imperishable monuments of art
by which he was surrounded seem to have breathed
something of their own spirit into him. He did a
great deal towards beautifying the town of Bonn;
built, besides churches and cloisters, an immense
palace, the present university, and greatly enlarged
the villa of Poppelsdorf, now the Natural History
Museum. His household was conducted on the most
magnificent scale, grand f&ecirc;tes were of common occurrence,
and his court was thronged by celebrities of
every rank.</p>

<p>Especially did the reputation of the court music<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
stand high. The archbishop, like his predecessor,
was a connoisseur, and selections from the operas of
Handel and the cantatas of Sebastian Bach were
performed at Bonn in a style worthy of the imperial
court at Vienna.</p>

<p>It was to this brilliant little capital, then, that
young Ludwig van Beethoven made his way in the
year 1732, with a light heart and still lighter purse,
and begged for an engagement as one of the court
musicians, which distinction, after the customary
year's probation, was formally granted him, with an
annual stipend of four hundred guldens, at that time
considered a very good income for so young a man.</p>

<p>His career seems to have been uniformly successful
and honourable. Existing documents speak of him
as successively simple <i>Musicus</i>, then <i>Dominus van
Beethoven</i>, next as <i>Musicus Anticus</i>, and finally in the
year 1761 as <i>Herr Kapellmeister</i>, when his name also
figures third in a list of twenty-eight <i>Hommes de
chambre Honoraires</i> in the "Court Calendar." This
success is the more remarkable when we reflect that
Ludwig van Beethoven the elder was no composer,
and in those days the musical director in the service
of a prince was expected to produce offhand, at an
hour's notice, appropriate music for every family
occurrence, festival or funeral; so that his appointment
as kapellmeister must have created no little
jealousy, especially as there were several eminent
composers at court. But in truth it would have been
impossible for him to find much time for composition
amid the multifarious duties that devolved upon him.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>In addition to the general responsibility over all
pertaining to musical matters, including the oversight
of the numerous singers, choristers, and instrumentalists
in the Elector's service, he was expected
to conduct in church, in the theatre, on private
occasions at court, to examine the candidates for
vacancies in the choir and orchestra, and also to take
the bass part in several operas and cantatas. Truly
the Herr Kapellmeister held no sinecure, if his royal
master did!</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, he seems to have led a quiet,
even-going life, able, unlike the most of his colleagues,
to lay by a little sum of money, happy in the exercise
of his art (alas, poor man! domestic bliss was
denied him), respected and beloved by all.</p>

<p>Such was the grandfather of the great Beethoven.
He died when the boy was but three years of age;
nevertheless the old man in the scarlet robe usually
worn at that time by elderly people, with his dark
complexion and flashing eye, seems to have made no
ordinary impression on Beethoven's childish mind.
He always spoke with reverence of his grandfather,
whom he doubtless regarded as the founder of the
family, and the only relic that he cared to have when
settled in Vienna was a portrait of the old man,
which he begs his friend Wegeler in a letter to send
him from Bonn.</p>

<p>We have hinted that Ludwig van Beethoven was
not happy in his home. If every one is haunted by
some skeleton, his was grim enough. Not many years
after their marriage his wife Josepha had become<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
addicted to drinking, and in fact her habits were such
that it was found necessary to place her in the restraint
of a convent at Cologne. Thayer attributes this
failing to grief for the loss of her children, only one of
whom lived to manhood; but this trait in her character
was unfortunately reproduced in her son Johann.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The latter appears to have been a man of vacillating,
inert temperament, gifted with a good voice and
artistic sensibility, but not capable of any sustained
effort. At the age of twenty-four we find him filling
the post of Tenor in the Electoral Chapel with the
miserable stipend of one hundred thalers, and not
distinguished in any way, unless we except his ingenuity
in spelling or misspelling his own name in the
petitions which he from time to time addressed to
the Elector for an increase of salary. In these he
calls himself <i>Bethoven</i>, <i>Betthoven</i>, <i>Bethof</i>, <i>Biethoffen</i>;
but this instance does not warrant us in concluding
that he was a man of no education whatever, for the
orthography even of those who considered themselves
scholars was at that time very erratic.</p>

<p>At the age of twenty-seven, on an income not
much larger than that just mentioned, Johann van
Beethoven took unto himself a wife. The entry in
the register of the parish of St. Remigius runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
"Copulavi&mdash; <span style="margin-left:30em;"> "Nov. 12, 1767.</span>
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Johannem van Beethoven</span>, filium
legitimum <span class="smcap">Ludovici van Beethoven</span> et <span class="smcap">Mari&aelig;
Joseph&aelig; Poll</span>,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>
<p class="center">Et<br /></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mariam Magdalenam Keferich</span>,
viduam <span class="smcap">Leym</span>, ex Ehrenbreitstein, filiam <span class="smcap">Henrici
Keferich</span> et <span class="smcap">Ann&aelig; Mari&aelig; Westroffs</span>."</p></div>

<p>The object of his choice was a young widow,
Maria Magdalena, daughter of the head cook at the
castle of Ehrenbreitstein. Her first husband, Johann
Leym, one of the <i>valets de chambre</i> to the Elector of
Treves, had left her a widow at the age of nineteen.
The fruit of this plebeian union between the tenor
singer of the Electoral Chapel and the daughter of
the head cook to his Grace the Archbishop of Treves
was the great maestro.</p>

<p>What a downfall must the discovery of this fact
have been to the numerous Viennese admirers of
Beethoven, who for long persisted in attributing to
him a noble origin, confounding the Flemish particle
<i>van</i> with the aristocratic <i>von</i>! It was impossible, they
thought, that Beethoven's undoubted aristocratic
leanings could be compatible with so humble a
parentage. Hence the absurd fable, promulgated by
Fayolle and Choron, which represented him as a
natural son of Frederic II., King of Prussia, which
was indignantly repudiated by Beethoven himself.</p>

<p>In general careless of his own reputation, he could
not bear that the slightest breath of slander should
touch his mother; and in a letter addressed to Wegeler
begged him to "make known to the world the honour
of his parents, particularly of his mother." Her
memory was always regarded by him with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
deepest tenderness, and he was wont to speak
lovingly of the "great patience she had with his
waywardness."</p>

<p>We cannot conclude this short sketch better than
by presenting the reader with Thayer's picturesque
description of Bonn, as it must have appeared in the
eyes of the young Beethoven.</p>

<p>The old town itself wore an aspect very similar to
that of the present day. There were the same
churches and cloisters, the same quaint flying bridge,
the same ruins of Drachenfels and Godesberg towering
above the same orchard-embedded villages. The
Seven Hills looked quietly down on the same classic
Rhine, not as yet desecrated by puffing tourist-laden
steamboat or shrieking locomotive.</p>

<p>Gently and evenly flowed the life-current in the
Elector's capital, no foreboding of nineteenth century
bustle and excitement causing even a ripple on the
calm surface.</p>

<p>"Let our imagination paint for us a fine Easter or
Whitsun morning in those times, and show us the
little town in its holiday adornment and bustle.</p>

<p>"The bells are ringing from castle tower and church
steeple; the country people, in coarse but comfortable
garments (the women overladen with gay colours),
come in from the neighbouring villages, fill the
market-places, and throng into the churches to early
mass.</p>

<p>"The nobles and principal citizens, in ample low-hanging
coats, wide vests, and knee-breeches (the
whole suit composed of some bright-coloured stuff<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>silk,
satin, or velvet), with great white fluttering cravats,
ruffles over the hands; buckles of silver, or even
of gold, below the knee and on the shoes; high frizzed
and powdered perruques on the head, covered with a
cocked hat, if the latter be not tucked underneath
the arm; a sword by the side, and generally a gold-headed
cane; and, if the morning be cold, a scarlet
mantle thrown over the shoulders.</p>

<p>"Thus attired they decorously direct their steps to
the castle to kiss the hand of his Serene Highness, or
drive in at the gates in ponderous equipages, surmounted
by white-powdered, cocked-hatted coachman
and footman.</p>

<p>"Their wives wear long narrow bodices with immense
flowing skirts. Their shoes with very high
heels, and the towering rolls over which their hair is
dressed, give them an appearance of greater height
than they in reality possess. They wear short
sleeves, but long silk gloves cover their arms.</p>

<p>"The clergy of different orders and dress are attired
as at the present day, with the exception of the
streaming wigs. The Electoral Guard has turned
out, and from time to time the thunder of the firing
from the walls reaches the ear.</p>

<p>"On all sides strong and bright contrasts meet the
eye; velvet and silk, 'purple and fine linen,' gold
and silver. Such was the taste of the period; expensive
and incommodious in form, but imposing,
magnificent, and indicative of the distinction between
the different grades of society."</p>

<p>Such was the Bonn of 1770.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

</div>
<p>n the 17th of December, 1770, in the old
house in the Bonngasse, Ludwig van
Beethoven first saw the light. He was not
the eldest child, Johann having about eighteen
months previously lost a son who had also been
christened Ludwig.</p>

<p>Beethoven's infant years flew by happily, the
grandfather being still alive, and able to make good
any deficiency in his son's miserable income; but in
the year 1773 the old man was gathered to his
fathers, and the little household left to face that
struggle with poverty which embittered Beethoven's
youth.</p>

<p>The father, however, was not yet the hardened,
reckless man he afterwards became, and could still
take pleasure in the manifest joy exhibited by his
little son whenever he sat at the pianoforte and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
played or sang. The sound of his father's voice was
sufficient to draw the child from any game, and great
was his delight when Johann placed his little fingers
among the keys and taught him to follow the melody
of the song.</p>

<p>On the title-page of the three Sonatas dedicated
to the Elector Maximilian Friedrich, Beethoven says,
"From my fourth year music has been my favourite
pursuit;" and such would seem to have been really
the case.</p>

<p>The readiness with which the child learned was,
however, unfortunate for him. No long interval had
elapsed since the extraordinary performances of the
young Mozarts had astonished the whole musical
world, and the evil genius of Johann van Beethoven
now prompted him to turn his son's talents to the
same account. He resolved to make of Ludwig
a prodigy, and foresaw in his precocious efforts a
mine of wealth which would do away with any
necessity for exertion on his part, and allow him
to give full scope to what was fast becoming his
dominant passion.</p>

<p>With this end in view he undertook the musical
education of his boy, and the little amusing lessons,
at first given in play, now became sad and serious
earnest. Ludwig was kept at the pianoforte morning,
noon, and night, till the child began positively to
hate what he had formerly adored.</p>

<p>Still the father was relentless: Handel, Bach,
Mozart, all had been great as child-musicians; and if
the boy (only a baby of five years) showed signs of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
obstinacy or sulkiness, he must be forced into submission
by cruel threats and still more cruel punishments.
Many a time was the little Ludwig seen in
tears, standing on a raised bench before his pianoforte,
thus early serving his apprenticeship to grief.</p>

<p>In short, Johann was fast doing all he could to
ruin the genius of his son, when, fortunately for the
world, it soon became evident that if Ludwig were to
do wonders as a prodigy, he would require a better
teacher than his father, and the boy was accordingly
handed over to one Pfeiffer, an oboist in the theatre,
and probably a lodger in Johann's house.</p>

<p>This man seems to have been of a genial, kindly
nature, though only too willing to second his landlord's
views with regard to the boy; for we learn that
when the two came home from the tavern far on in
the night (as was too often the case) the little Ludwig
would be dragged from his bed and kept at the
pianoforte till daybreak! Beethoven seems, however,
to have had a great regard for Pfeiffer, who was
an excellent pianist, and from whom he declared he
had learned more than from any one else.</p>

<p>On hearing many years after that he was broken
down and in poverty, he sent him, through Simrock
the music publisher, a sum of money.</p>

<p>This ruthless conduct on the part of Johann, though
unjustifiable and inhuman, probably layed the foundation
of the technical skill and power over the
pianoforte which so greatly distinguished Beethoven.
It is not positively certain that the father gained his
end, and made money by exhibiting the child, though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
we have the testimony of the widow Karth (who as a
child inhabited the same house as the Beethovens)
that on one occasion the mother made a journey to
Holland and Belgium&mdash;probably to some relations in
Louvain,&mdash;where she received several considerable
presents from noble personages before whom the
wonder-child had performed. This, however, is a
mere childish reminiscence, not to be depended on,
though it certainly coincides with all we know of
Johann's character.</p>

<p>The boy was also forced to learn the violin, and
this he disliked infinitely more than the piano, a fact
which puts to flight the pretty anecdote narrated in
the "Arachnologie" of Quatrem&egrave;re Disjonval, who
gravely states that whenever the boy began to practise&mdash;in
an old ruined garret filled with broken furniture
and dilapidated music-books&mdash;a spider was in the
habit of leaving its hiding-place, and perching itself
upon his violin till he had finished. When his mother
discovered her son's little companion she killed it,
whereupon this second Orpheus, filled with indignation,
smashed his instrument! Beethoven himself
remembered nothing about this, and used to laugh
heartily at the story, saying it was far more probable
that his discordant growls frightened away every
living thing&mdash;down to flies and spiders.</p>

<p>When he was nine years old, Pfeiffer left Bonn to
act as bandmaster in a Bavarian regiment, and the
boy was placed under the care of Van den Eeden,
the court organist. At his death, which took place
not long after, Ludwig was transferred to his suc<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>cessor,
Christian Gottlob Neefe, whose pupil he remained
for several years.</p>

<p>This Neefe, long since forgotten, was one of the
best musicians of the time, and thought worthy to be
named in the same breath with Bach and Graun.
He was a ready composer, and the favourite pupil of
Johann Adam Hiller, Bach's successor as Cantor in
the Thomasschule at Leipzig. He appears, moreover,
to have been an amiable, conscientious man,
and so high did his artistic reputation stand that he,
although a Protestant, was tolerated as organist in
the archbishop's private chapel.</p>

<p>How comes it, then, that with all these qualifications
Beethoven would not afterwards allow that he
had profited by his instructions? The question is
not easily solved. Beethoven himself wrote from
Vienna to his old teacher in 1793, "I thank you for
the advice which you often gave me whilst striving in
my divine art. If I ever become a great man you
have a share in it."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this tribute there was a coldness
between them. It may be that master and pupil had
not that entire sympathy with each other which is
essential to any worthy result from the relationship.</p>

<p>Beethoven, as we know, was self-willed, and overflowing
with an originality which, even at that early
age, would not easily brook dictation. Neefe, on the
other hand, was a <i>young</i> man, and endowed, as he
himself tells us in his Autobiography, with a certain
satirical tendency, which he may have allowed somewhat
too free play in criticising<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
his young pupil's efforts in composition. If the latter
conjecture be correct, it gives the clue to the earnest
advice Beethoven was wont to give the critics in after
years&mdash;never to judge the performances of a beginner
harshly, as "many would thus be deterred from following
out what they might, perhaps, have ultimately
succeeded in." Contempt to a sensitive, shrinking
nature is like the blast of the east wind on a tender
flower; downright condemnation is easier to bear
than the sneer which throws the young aspirant,
smarting and humiliated, back into himself&mdash;his best
energies withered for the moment.</p>

<p>Whatever Beethoven's feeling to Neefe may have
been, it did not, at any rate, prevent his making
very decided progress under his tuition, at which
the organist himself rejoiced, as we learn from the
following letter written by him, and published in
<i>Cramer's Magazine</i>&mdash;the first printed notice of Beethoven:&mdash;"Louis
van Beethoven, son of the Tenor
mentioned above, a boy of eleven years, with talent
of great promise. He plays the pianoforte with
great execution and power, reads very well at sight,
and, to say all in brief, plays almost the whole of
Sebastian Bach's 'Wohl-temperirte Clavier,' which
Herr Neefe has put into his hands. He who knows
this collection of preludes and fugues through all the
keys (which one might almost call the <i>non plus ultra</i>)
will understand what this implies. Herr Neefe has
also given him, so far as his other occupations permit,
some introduction to the study of thorough-bass.
Now he exercises him in composition, and for his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
encouragement has had printed in Mannheim nine
variations for the pianoforte written by him on a
March. This young genius deserves help in order
that he may travel. He will certainly be a second
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart if he continue as he has
begun."</p>

<p>What could be kinder than the tone of this letter?</p>

<p>The allusion to Mozart in the last sentence does
credit to Neefe's discernment, as the great composer
was at that time comparatively little known. It is
to be presumed that at this period Beethoven also
studied the works of C.P.E. Bach, since there is
evidence that he was familiar with them. His progress,
in short, was such that we find him in 1782, when
he had not completed his twelfth year, installed as
Neefe's representative at the organ, while the latter
was absent on a journey of some duration.</p>

<p>Thus we may picture the boy Beethoven to ourselves,
at an age when other children are frolicsome
and heedless, as already a little man, earnest, grave,
reserved, buried in his own thoughts, his Bach, and his
organ. He had no time to join his young companions
in their games, even had his inclination prompted
him to do so; for besides the hours devoted to music,
he attended the public school, where he went through
the usual elementary course, and learned besides a
little Latin. His knowledge of the latter must, however,
have been very slight, as when composing his
first Mass he was obliged to make use of a translation,
which, considering that he was brought up in a
Catholic family, is singular enough. Johann v. Beet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>hoven
was not the man to waste money, as he thought,
on giving his son a liberal education, so that the
degree of culture attained by Beethoven was due only
to his own efforts and the influences afterwards thrown
around him.</p>

<p>In the year 1783 the three sonatas already alluded
to were published, Beethoven at the time being nearly
thirteen&mdash;not <i>eleven</i> years of age as was stated,&mdash;the
falsifying of his age being part of his father's plan
with regard to him. We give the dedication entire,
because (though probably not written wholly by
Beethoven himself) it offers a curious contrast to his
subsequent ideas regarding the princes and great
ones of the earth:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Most illustrious Prince! From my fourth year
music has been my favourite pursuit. So early
acquainted with the sweet Muse, who attuned my
soul to pure harmonies, I won her, and methought
was loved by her in return. I have now attained my
eleventh year, and my Muse has often whispered to
me in hours of inspiration, Try to write down the
harmonies of thy soul! Eleven years old, thought I,
how would the character of author become me? and
what would riper artists say to it? I felt some
trepidation. But my Muse willed it&mdash;I obeyed, and
wrote.</p>

<p>"And dare I now, most Serene Highness, venture
to lay the first fruits of my youthful labour before
your throne? and may I hope that you will cast on
them the encouraging glance of your approval? Oh

in you a wise protector, a generous patron; and rising
talent has thriven under your fatherly care. Filled
with this cheering conviction I venture to approach
you with these youthful efforts.</p>

<p>"Accept them as the pure offering of childlike
reverence, and look with favour,</p>

<span style="margin-left:12em;">"On them and their young composer,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left:15em;">"<span class="smcap">Ludwig van Beethoven</span>."</span><br />
</div>

<p>It has been generally imagined that Neefe was
paid by the Elector for the instruction given to
Beethoven, but this is merely a supposition, without
any proof whatever. It is more than likely that
Neefe considered the assistance rendered to him by
the boy an equivalent for his lessons. We have seen
how, as early as 1782, he was qualified to relieve him
in the organ duty, rather a heavy task, owing to the
number of services at which the organist was expected
to be present.</p>

<p>In addition to this, Neefe soon found another
way of employing him&mdash;but this will require a little
explanation.</p>

<p>Whilst awaiting his appointment as court organist,
Neefe had acted as musical director to a troupe of
singers known as the Grossmann Company, from
the name of the leader and organizer. This was
one of the best operatic companies in Germany,
all its members being actors of experience and
reputation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>Now it had entered the Elector's head to take this
company into his own service, and found a national
theatre (in imitation of that at Vienna) which should
serve as a school of refinement for the worthy citizens
of Bonn. Neefe found himself, therefore, burdened
with double duties as conductor and organist, and in
the season of 1783, owing to the absence of one of his
colleagues (the well-known Lucchesi), was almost
overwhelmed with work. He found it impossible to
attend the morning rehearsals in the theatre, and
accordingly young Ludwig was appointed <i>cembalist</i>
in the orchestra, <i>i.e.</i>, to preside at the pianoforte. In
those days this was considered a distinction (as such
Haydn regarded it in London), and in fact only an
accomplished musician could fill the post, as all the
accompaniments were played from the score.</p>

<p>To this early initiation may be attributed the
extreme facility with which Beethoven read, <i>a prima
vista</i>, the most involved and complicated scores, even
when in manuscript, and that manuscript written by
a Bach in a manner calculated to drive any ordinary
reader to despair.</p>

<p>For two seasons young Ludwig was the accompanist
at all rehearsals, and in addition to the advantage
of thus working out in the most practical way all that
he learned of theory, he also gained a thorough
acquaintance with the works of Gr&eacute;try and Gluck.</p>

<p>The operas were varied by dramatic representations,
and these must have had an immense influence on
the observant, reflective boy; for the <i>r&eacute;pertoire</i> of
the company was large, and embraced not only the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
standard pieces of the day, but the new plays of
Lessing, and "The Robbers" of Schiller, which had
begun to create a ferment of excitement throughout
Germany; besides translations from Moli&egrave;re, Goldoni,
and our own Garrick and Cumberland.</p>

<p>To return to our young <i>cembalist</i>, the two years
1783-84 must have been a busy time to him between
the chapel and the orchestra, but not a penny did he
receive for his services, although he may have earned
a trifle by playing the organ every morning at the
six o'clock mass in the church of St. Remigius.</p>

<p>When he was thirteen, however, through Neefe's
influence he was nominated officially to the post he
had so long filled in reality, that of assistant organist,
and would have drawn a salary but for an event which
threw him back again.</p>

<p>The Elector Max Friedrich died, the operatic
company was dismissed, and Neefe, having nothing
to do but play his organ, had no further need of an
assistant.</p>

<p>This must have been a great blow to the boy; not
that he cared for the money in itself, but he knew
how it would have lightened his poor mother's cares,
and shed a gleam of sunshine over the poverty-stricken
household.</p>

<p>His father was now beginning to throw off all
restraint; his failing was generally known, and more
than once he was rescued from the hands of the
police and brought home by his son in a state of
unconsciousness. Long ere this, two sons, Caspar
Anton Carl and Nikolaus Johann, respectively four<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
and six years younger than Ludwig, had been added
to the family, and doubtless many were the secret
councils between the boy and his mother as to how
the few thalers of Johann (<i>minus</i> what was spent in
the alehouse) could be made to meet the needs of the
household. It was probably about this time that
Beethoven began to give lessons, that most wearisome
of all employments to him, and so for more than a
year, to the great hindrance of his own studies, contributed
his mite to the general fund.</p>

<p>The year 1785, however, brought with it a little
heartening; Ludwig's former appointment as assistant
organist was confirmed by the new Elector, and with
the yearly stipend of a hundred thalers an era of hope
dawned for the lad.</p>

<p>Max Franz, Archbishop of Cologne, was the
youngest son of Maria Theresa, and the favourite of
his brother, the Emperor Joseph II., whom he
strongly resembled in character and disposition.</p>

<p>To any one familiar with the musical history of the
period and the Emperor's relation to Mozart, this will
be sufficient to indicate the pleasure with which the
Bonn musicians must have hailed his advent. Nor
were their expectations disappointed; Max Franz
surpassed his predecessors not only in the munificence
of his support, but (what is perhaps of more
importance) in the real interest shown by him in the
progress of art at his court. Neither did he confine
his patronage to music alone (though, as was natural
in a son of Maria Theresa, this was his first care);
painting, science, and literature alike felt the in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>fluence
of his generous mind. The university was
founded and endowed by him, and the utmost efforts
made to meet that universal demand for a higher
culture, and that striving after truth in art, which the
works of Schlegel, Lessing, Schiller, Goethe, and
others were rapidly disseminating throughout the
length and breadth of Germany. As Wegeler (the
friend and biographer of Beethoven, at that time
a medical student of nineteen) writes, "It was a
splendid, stirring time in many ways at Bonn, so
long as the genial Elector, Max Franz, reigned
there." It can readily be imagined, therefore, that
a youth so full of promise as Beethoven could not
escape the notice of such a prince, and that to his
own talents, backed by the recommendation of Neefe&mdash;not
to the influence of any patron&mdash;he owed the
only official appointment ever held by him.</p>

<p>For the next year he seems to have had a comparatively
easy life, his salary no doubt going to his
mother, and the little he could make by teaching
carefully put aside for a great purpose he had formed.
A characteristic anecdote of this period is worth repeating,
inasmuch as Beethoven himself used often
to speak of it with glee in after life as a specimen of
his boyish achievements.</p>

<p>In the old style of church music, on the Tuesday,
Friday, and Saturday of Passion Week it was usual to
sing select portions from the Lamentations of Jeremiah,
consisting of short phrases of from four to six
lines. In the middle of each phrase a pause was
made, which the accompanist was expected to fill up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
as his fancy might dictate by a free interlude on the
pianoforte&mdash;the organ being prohibited during these
three days. Now it so happened that the singer to
whom this was allotted in the Electoral Chapel was
one Heller, a thoroughly well-practised but somewhat
boastful musician. To him Beethoven declared
that he was able to throw him out in his part without
employing any means but such as were perfectly
justifiable. Heller resented the insinuation, and
rashly accepted a wager on the subject. When
the appropriate point was reached, Beethoven ingeniously
modulated to a key so remote from the
original one, that although he continued to hold fast
the key-note of the latter, and struck it repeatedly
with his little finger, Heller was completely thrown
out, and obliged abruptly to stop. Franz Ries the
violinist, father of the afterwards celebrated Ferdinand,
and Lucchesi, who were present, declared
themselves perfectly astounded at the occurrence,
and the mystified singer rushed in a tumult of rage
and mortification to the Elector and complained of
Beethoven. The good-humoured Max Franz, however,
rather enjoyed the story, and merely ordered
the young organist to content himself with a more
simple accompaniment for the future.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1787, Ludwig at length reached
the height of his boyish aspirations. His little
savings had accumulated to what was in his eyes
a large sum, and he looked forward with eagerness
to a journey to Vienna. It has been supposed that
the funds for this visit were supplied by others, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
this is improbable. At that time Beethoven had no
wealthy friends; there is no evidence to show that
the Archbishop assisted him, and certain is it that no
money was forthcoming from his father. We are
obliged to fall back upon the supposition that his
own scanty earnings, eked out perhaps by his mother,
were his only means, especially as we know that
they proved insufficient for his purpose, and that he
was obliged to borrow money for his journey home.</p>

<p>What were Beethoven's intentions with regard to
this visit?</p>

<p>His father's conduct, which must have many a
time brought the flush of shame to his young brow,
his mother's evidently failing health, the numerous
unsupplied wants of the family, now increased by
the birth of a daughter,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>&mdash;all these circumstances
combined to urge on his sensitive, loving nature the
necessity of making some exertion, of taking some
decided step for the assistance of his dear ones.</p>

<p>Vienna, so far away, was his goal; there were assembled
all the great and noble in art&mdash;Gluck,
Haydn, Mozart! the very mention of these names
must have roused the responsive throb of genius
in the lad. To Vienna he would go, and surely if
there were any truth in the adage that "like draws
to like," these men must recognise the undeveloped
powers within him; and help him to attain his object.</p>

<p>That some such hopes as these must have beat
high in Beethoven's breast, animating him for the
effort, is evident from the reaction that set in, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
despair that took possession of him when he found
himself forced by the iron course of events to abandon
his project.</p>

<p>Arrived in the great capital he obtained an interview
with Mozart, and played before him. The
maestro, however, rewarded his performance with but
feeble praise, looking upon it as mere parade; and
probably in technical adroitness the boy before him
was far behind the little Hummel, at that time under
his tuition; for Beethoven's style, through his constant
organ-playing, was somewhat heavy and rough.</p>

<p>Beethoven, sensitively alive to everything, perceived
Mozart's opinion, and requested a thema for
an improvisation. Somewhat sceptically Mozart
complied, and now the boy, roused by the doubt cast
upon his abilities, extemporized with a clearness of
idea and richness of embellishment that took his
auditor by storm. Mozart went excitedly to the
bystanders in the anteroom, saying, "Pay heed to
this youth&mdash;much will one day be said about him in
the world!"</p>

<p>The amiable Mozart did not live to see the fulfilment
of his prophecy, but he appears to have taken
an interest in the boy, and to have given him a few
lessons.</p>

<p>Beethoven afterwards lamented that he had never
heard Mozart play, which may perhaps be accounted
for by the fact that the master was much occupied at
the time with his "Don Giovanni," and also had that
year to mourn the loss of his father.</p>

<p>The following letter fully explains the cause of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Beethoven's sudden departure from Vienna, and the
apparent shipwreck of all his hopes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span class="smcap">Most worthy and dear Friend</span>,&mdash;I can

you have well-founded reasons for not entertaining

<p>"But I will not excuse myself until I have explained
the reasons which lead me to hope that my apologies
will be accepted.</p>

<p>"I must tell you that with my departure from Augsburg,
my cheerfulness, and with it my health, began
to decline. The nearer I came to my native city, the
more frequent were the letters which I received from
my father, urging me to travel as quickly as possible,
as my mother's health gave great cause for anxiety.
I hurried onwards, therefore, as fast as I could, although
myself far from well. The longing to see
my dying mother once more did away with all
hindrances, and helped me to overcome the greatest
difficulties. My mother was indeed still alive, but in
the most deplorable state; her complaint was consumption;
and about seven weeks ago, after enduring
much pain and suffering, she died.</p>

<p>"Ah! who was happier than I, so long as I could

<p>"Since I have been here, I have enjoyed but few

to fear may eventually result in consumption. To
this is added melancholy, for me an evil as great as
my illness itself.</p>

<p>ow "flat, stale, and unprofitable" must everything
in Bonn have appeared to our Beethoven
after the charms of Vienna&mdash;charms
real in themselves, and surrounded by the ideal
nimbus of his fresh young hopes and strivings! The
desolate, motherless home, his neglected orphan brothers,
his drunken father, the weary round of teaching,&mdash;it
was no light task for an impetuous, ardent
genius to lift; but it had to be faced, and with a
noble self-sacrifice he entered on the dreary path
before him.</p>

<p>He had his reward&mdash;the very occupation which he
disliked more than any other, opened up to him a
friendship which secured to him more peace and
happiness than he had yet known, and whose influence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
was potent throughout his whole life&mdash;that, namely,
with the family Von Breuning.</p>

<p>Madame von Breuning was a widow; her husband,
a state councillor and a member of one of the best
families in Bonn, had perished in the attempt to
rescue the Electoral Archives from a fire that had
broken out in the palace, and since this calamity she
had lived quietly with her brother, the canon and
scholar, Abraham v. Keferich, solely engaged in the
education of her children. These were four in number:
three boys&mdash;Christoph, Stephan, and Lenz; and one
girl&mdash;Eleanore. It appears that Beethoven (who was
about four years older than Stephan) was receiving
violin lessons at the same time with the latter from
Franz Ries; and Stephan, struck, no doubt, with the
genius of his fellow-pupil, managed to get him introduced
to his mother's house in the capacity of
pianoforte teacher to the little Lenz. Madame von
Breuning was not slow to perceive the extraordinary
gifts of her son's new acquaintance; and learning
incidentally, with her woman's tact, the sad state of
matters at home, opened her heart as well as her
house to the motherless boy. He soon became one
of the family, and used to spend the greater part of
the day and often the night with his new friends.</p>

<p>It is impossible to over-estimate the value of this
friendship to the young man. What a contrast to
his own neglected home did the well-ordered house
of Madame v. Breuning present! Now for the first
time he was admitted to mix on equal terms with
people of culture; here he first enjoyed the refining<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
influence of female society (did any remembrance of
Leonore suggest his ideal heroine?); and here also
he first became acquainted with the literature of his
own and other countries.</p>

<p>The young Breunings were all intellectual, and in
the pursuit of their studies they were encouraged and
assisted by their uncle, the canon. Christoph wrote
very good verses, and Stephan also tried his hand at
some, which were not bad. The striving of these
young people would naturally lead our sensitive
musician to reflect on his own defective education,
and to endeavour so to rectify it as to render himself
worthy of their friendship. Beethoven's love of the
ancient classical writers may be traced to this period,
when Christoph and Stephan were studying them in
the original with their uncle, though it is not probable
that he ever learned Greek. His knowledge of Homer
was gained through Voss's translation, and his well-worn
copy of the "Odyssey" testifies to the earnest
study it had received from him. French and Italian
he seems to have been acquainted with so far as
he deemed it necessary; but his principal literary
studies were confined to Lessing, B&uuml;rger, Wieland,
and Klopstock. The last especially was his favourite,
and his constant companion in the solitary rambles
among the mountains which he was fond of indulging
in. There, alone with the nature he venerated, the
sonorous lines and rolling periods of the German
Milton sank deeply into his mind, to be reproduced
years after in immortal harmonies. At a later period
Klopstock was replaced in Beethoven's esteem by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Goethe, of whose poems he was wont to say that
they "exercised a great sway over him, not only by
their meaning, but by their rhythm also. Their
language urged him on to composition."</p>

<p>But of all the blissful influences which tended to
make this time the happiest in his life, not one was
so powerful as that of Madame von Breuning herself.
To her everlasting honour be it said that she was the
first of the very few individuals who ever thoroughly
understood the morbid and apparently contradictory
character of Beethoven; and greatly is it to the credit
of the latter that he merited the love of such a woman.
Not his abilities alone gave him a place in her heart;
it was his true, noble, generous nature that won for
him a continuance of the favours first bestowed upon
the artist. Madame v. Breuning thoroughly appreciated
Beethoven; he felt that she did. Hence the
tacit confidence that existed between them&mdash;he
coming to her as to a mother, and she advising him
as she would have done one of her own sons.
Beethoven used to say of her that she understood
how to "keep the insects from the blossoms."</p>

<p>Even she, however, sometimes failed in one point,
that, namely, of inducing him to give his lessons
regularly. It has been hinted before that this was
an unpalatable task to Beethoven. Wegeler describes
him as going to it <i>ut iniqu&aelig; mentis asellus</i>, and this
dislike grew with every succeeding year. Even his
subsequent relation to his illustrious friend and pupil,
the Archduke Rudolph, was in the highest degree
irksome to him; he looked upon it as a mere court<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
service. But while in Bonn our composer was not in
a position to choose his occupation. "Necessity
knows no law," and the higher claims of genius were
forced to submit to very sublunary considerations.
Madame v. Breuning's representations would sometimes
succeed so far as to induce him to go to the house
of his pupil; but it was generally only to say that he
"could not give his lesson at that time&mdash;he would
give two the next day instead." On such occasions
she would smile and say, "Ah! Beethoven is in a
<i>raptus</i> again!" an expression which the composer
treasured up mentally, and was fond of applying to
himself in after life.</p>

<p>About this time also Beethoven gained another
friend, Count Waldstein, a young nobleman, who was
passing the probationary time previously to being admitted
into the Teutonic Order, at Bonn, under the
Grand-Master, Max Franz. Beethoven afterwards
expressed his obligations to him in the dedication of
the colossal sonata Op. 53.</p>

<p>He became a frequent visitor to the young organist's
miserable room, which he soon enlivened by the
present of a grand pianoforte, and here the friends&mdash;to
outward appearance so different&mdash;doubtless passed
many a happy hour, for Waldstein was an excellent
musician, and an enthusiastic admirer of Beethoven's
improvisations.</p>

<p>These were also one of the great pleasures in the
Breuning circle, where Wegeler relates that Beethoven
would often yield to the general request, and depict
on the pianoforte the character of some well-known<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
personage. On one occasion Franz Ries, who was
present, was asked to join, which he did&mdash;probably
the only instance on record of two artists improvising
on different instruments at one and the same
time.</p>

<p>We have long lost sight of Johann v. Beethoven,
however, and must retrace our steps to see what has
become of him. By the year 1789 he had grown so
hopelessly incapable that it was proposed to send
him out of Bonn on a pension of one hundred thalers,
while the remaining hundred of his former salary
should be spent on his children. This plan was not
fully carried out, but the father's salary was by the
Elector's orders paid into Ludwig's hands, and entrusted
to his management; so that the young man
of nineteen was the real head of the family.</p>

<p>The Elector Max Franz now followed the example
of his predecessor, and established a national theatre.
Beethoven was not this time <i>cembalist</i> to the company;
he played the viol in the orchestra, whither he was
often accompanied by his friend Stephan Breuning,
who handled the bow creditably enough. For four
years Beethoven occupied this post, and the solid
advantage it was to him is shown in his subsequent
orchestration.</p>

<p>In the autumn of the year 1791 an incident occurred
which broke the monotony of the court life, and gives
us an interesting side-glimpse of our young musician.
The Teutonic Order, referred to before, held a grand
conclave at Mergentheim, at which the Elector as
Grand-Master was obliged to be present. He had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
passed some months there two years before, and
had probably found time hang somewhat heavy on
his hands; at any rate, he resolved that his private
musical and theatrical staff should attend him on
this occasion.</p>

<p>The announcement of this determination was
received with great approbation by all concerned,
and Lux, the first comedian of the day, was
unanimously chosen king of the expedition. His
Majesty then proceeded to appoint the various
officers of the household, among whom Beethoven
and Bernhard Romberg (afterwards the greatest
violoncellist of his time) figure as Scullions. Two
ships were chartered for the occasion, and King Lux
and his court floated lazily down the Rhine and the
Main, between the sunny vine-clad hills where the
peasants were hard at work getting in the best
harvest of the year. It was a merry time, and, as
Beethoven afterwards said, "a fruitful source of the
most beautiful images."</p>

<p>We can imagine the boat gliding peacefully along
under the calm moonlit sky&mdash;Beethoven sitting by
himself, enjoying the unusual <i>dolce far niente</i>; his
companions a little apart are chanting a favourite
boat-song; the harmonious sounds rise and fall, alternating
with the gentle ripple on the water&mdash;and the
young maestro, pondering on his future life, tries to
read his destiny in the "golden writing" of the stars.
Is not some such scene the background to the
Adagio in the "Sonata quasi Fantasia," dedicated to
the Countess Giulietta?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>At Aschaffenburg, Simrock, a leading member of
the company (afterwards the celebrated music-publisher),
deemed it necessary that a deputation (which
included Beethoven) should pay a visit of respect to
the Abb&eacute; Sterkel, one of the greatest living pianists.</p>

<p>They were very graciously received, and the Abb&eacute;,
in compliance with the pressing request of his visitors,
sat down to the pianoforte, and played for some
time. Beethoven, who had never before heard the
instrument touched with the same elegance, listened
with the deepest attention, but refused to play when
requested to do so in his turn. It has been mentioned
that his style was somewhat hard and rough, and he
naturally feared the contrast with Sterkel's flowing
ease. In vain his companions, who, with true <i>esprit
de corps</i>, were proud of their young colleague, urged
him to the pianoforte, till the Abb&eacute; turning the
conversation on a work of Beethoven's, lately published,
hinted, with disdain either real or assumed,
that he did not believe the composer could master
the difficulties of it himself. (The work alluded to
was a series of twenty-four variations on Righini's
Theme "Vieni Amore.") This touched Beethoven's
honour; he yielded without further hesitation, and
not only played the published variations, but invented
others infinitely more complicated as he went
along, assuming the gliding, graceful style of Sterkel
in such a manner as utterly to bewilder the bystanders,
who overwhelmed him with applause.</p>

<p>It was perhaps after this display that he was promoted
to a higher post in King Lux's service by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
royal letters patent, and to this weighty document
a great seal&mdash;stamped in pitch on the lid of a little
box&mdash;was attached by threads made of unravelled
rope, which gave it quite an imposing aspect. Seven
years afterwards Wegeler discovered this <i>plaisanterie</i>
carefully treasured among Beethoven's possessions,
a proof of the enjoyment afforded him by this excursion.</p>

<p>At Mergentheim the sensation created by the
Elector's musicians was immense. In an old newspaper
exhumed by the indefatigable Thayer, the
following notice of Beethoven occurs.</p>

<p>The writer is Carl Ludwig Junker, chaplain to
Prince Hohenlohe, and himself a composer and
critic of no mean reputation. After giving a general
account of the whole orchestra, he goes on:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have heard one of the greatest players on the
pianoforte, the dear, worthy Beethoven.... I
believe we may safely estimate the artistic greatness
of this amiable man by the almost inexhaustible
wealth of his ideas, the expression&mdash;peculiar to
himself&mdash;with which he plays, and his great technical
skill. I should be at a loss to say what quality of
the great artist is still wanting to him. I have heard
Vogler<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> play on the pianoforte often, very often, and
for hours at a time, and have always admired his
great execution; but Beethoven, in addition to his
finished style, is more speaking, more significant,
more full of expression,&mdash;in short, more for the heart;
consequently as good an Adagio as an Allegro player.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>Even the first-rate artists of this orchestra are his
admirers, and all ear when he plays. He is excessively
modest, without any pretensions whatever....
His playing differs so materially from the
ordinary mode of touching the piano, that it appears
as though he had intended to lay out a path for
himself, in order to arrive at the perfection which he
has now attained."</p>

<p>But even the pleasantest things must come to an
end, and the expedition to Mergentheim was no
exception to the rule. In a few weeks, Archbishop,
musicians, and actors were once more at Bonn, busily
engaged in preparing for Christmas.</p>

<p>About this time Beethoven was nominated Court
pianist, an appointment due partly to his friend,
Count Waldstein, partly also to the following circumstance,
which gave the Elector a striking proof of his
young <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;'s</i> abilities. A new Trio by Pleyel had
been sent to Max Franz, and so great was his impatience
to hear it that nothing would content him
but its immediate performance, without previous
rehearsal, by Beethoven, Ries, and Romberg.</p>

<p>To hear was to obey, and the Trio was played
at sight very fairly, the performers keeping well
together. It was then discovered that two bars in
the pianoforte part had been omitted, and supplied
by Beethoven so ingeniously that not the slightest
break was perceptible!</p>

<p>In the same year, 1791, Beethoven wrote the music
for a splendid <i>bal masqu&eacute;</i>, organized by his friend
Waldstein, and attended by all the nobility for miles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
around. It was believed for long that Waldstein
was the author of the music.</p>

<p>Beethoven, meanwhile, continued his intimacy with
the Breuning family, where from time to time
another attraction offered itself in the person of
Fr&auml;ulein Jeannette d'Honrath, a young lady of
Cologne, who occasionally paid a visit of a few
weeks to her friend Eleanore.</p>

<p>It has been asserted by some writers that Beethoven
was insensible to the charms of woman, and
that love was to him a sealed book! For the refutation
of this statement it is only necessary to turn to
his works, which breathe a very different story to such
as have ears to hear. For those who have not, let
the testimony of his friend Wegeler suffice: "Beethoven
was <i>never</i> without a love, and generally in the
highest degree enamoured." The reason why his
love was fated never to expand and ripen will be
explained in its own place. Here it is sufficient to
say that Beethoven, while glowing with fire and
tenderness, eminently calculated to love and be loved,
was throughout his whole life, and in every relation,
delicacy itself; his nature shrunk instinctively from
anything like impurity.</p>

<p>To return: Mademoiselle Jeannette, a fascinating
little blonde, divided her attentions so equally
between Beethoven and his friend Stephan, and sang
so charmingly about her heart being <i>desol&eacute;</i> when the
time for parting came, that each believed himself the
favoured one, until it transpired that the "Herzchen
had long since been bestowed" in its entirety on a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
gallant Austrian officer, whom the young lady subsequently
married, and who afterwards rose to the
rank of general.</p>

<p>There does not seem to have been any attachment
between Beethoven and Leonore; she was his pupil,
his sister,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> but nothing more; her affections were
already given to young Wegeler, whose wife she
afterwards became.</p>

<p>So our Beethoven was left to gnaw his fingers for
the loss of his pretty Jeannette, and to flutter on the
outside of the crowd which hovered round fair Barbara
Koch, the beauty of Bonn, daughter of a widow,
proprietress of a coffee-house or tavern.</p>

<p>What! exclaims the reader, is this an instance of
the so-called "aristocratic leanings" of Beethoven?</p>

<p>We must beg him in reply not to look at things
through exclusively British and nineteenth century
spectacles. The position of worthy Frau Koch was,
if not distinguished, certainly respectable.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>
<p>Lewes, in his Life of Goethe, was obliged to combat
with the same prejudice in his account of the poet's
student days at Leipzig, and we cannot do better
than quote his words with regard to the society to be
found in a German Wirthshaus of the period:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The <i>table d'h&ocirc;te</i> is composed of a circle of
habitu&eacute;s, varied by occasional visitors, who in time
become, perhaps, members of the circle. Even with
strangers conversation is freely interchanged, and in a
little while friendships are formed, as natural tastes
and likings assimilate, which are carried out into the
current of life."</p>

<p>The habitu&eacute;s of Frau Koch's house were the professors
and students at the university, and such
members of the Electoral household as were engaged
in artistic pursuits. It was a rendezvous for them all,
where science, literature, art, and politics were discussed
by able men; and here, doubtless, Beethoven,
with his friends Stephan Breuning and young Reicha
(nephew of the director), spent many a pleasant
evening. The fair Babette was, as we have hinted,
no small attraction. She was a cultivated woman,
and the great friend of Eleanore v. Breuning. She
afterwards became governess to the children of
Count Anton von Belderbusch, whom she finally
married.</p>

<p>We now come to an event which completely changed
the current of Beethoven's life&mdash;the return of Joseph
Haydn from his second visit to London. As he
passed through Bonn the musicians gave him a
public breakfast at Godesberg, on which occasion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Beethoven laid before him a cantata of his composition&mdash;probably
that on the death of Leopold II. It met
with the warmest praise from Haydn, but the author
apparently did not think highly of it himself, as it
was never printed.</p>

<p>Whether the arrangements were made at this time
for Haydn's reception of Beethoven as his pupil,
or negotiated afterwards through Waldstein, is not
known. Certain it is that in the October of 1792 we
find his long-delayed hopes on the point of realization,
a pension from the Elector having removed all difficulties.</p>

<p>Beethoven had often bemoaned in secret, and
specially to his friend Waldstein, the irregular, broken
instruction he had received, attributing Mozart's early
success to the systematic course of study he had
pursued under the guidance of his father. It is a
question, however, whether Beethoven&mdash;even had he
enjoyed the advantages of Mozart&mdash;would ever have
composed with the facility of the latter. Thayer
thinks not; there is evidence enough in the symphonies,
&amp;c., of our great master to prove that he
"earned his bread by the sweat of his brow."</p>

<p>The following note from Waldstein evinces the
deep interest he took in Beethoven, and his faith in
the young composer's genius:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Beethoven</span>,&mdash;"You are now going to
Vienna for the realization of your wishes, so long
frustrated. The Genius of Mozart still mourns and
laments the death of his disciple. He found refuge
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>with the inexhaustible Haydn, but no scope for action,
and through him he now wishes once more to be
united to some one. Receive, through unbroken
industry, the spirit of Mozart from the hands of
Haydn.</p>

</p></div>

<p>In the beginning of November, then, 1792, Beethoven
finally took leave of his boyhood's friends&mdash;father
and brothers, Wegeler, Franz Ries, Neefe,
Reicha, Waldstein, pretty Barbara Koch, and, hardest
of all, the Breunings.</p>

<p>Some of these he saw for the last time.</p>

<p>ehold, then, our young musician at the
long-desired goal&mdash;free from all depressing,
pecuniary cares, with his pension secure from
the Elector, and a little fund of his own to boot. He
reached the capital about the middle of November,
alone and friendless; nor is there any proof that the
advent of the insignificant, clumsily built provincial
youth made the slightest sensation, or roused the
interest of one individual among the many thousands
who thronged the busy streets.</p>

<p>His first care, as shown from a little pocket-book
still preserved, was to seek out a lodging suitable to
his slender purse; his next, to procure a pianoforte.
The first requirement he at length met with in a
small room on "a sunk floor," which commended itself
by the low rent asked for it. Here Beethoven con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>tentedly
located himself until fortune's smiles had
begun to beam so brightly on him that he felt entitled
to remove to more airy lodgings.</p>

<p>We may be sure that he lost no time in setting
about the purpose which he had most at heart, and
enrolling himself among Haydn's pupils, for he could
not have been more than eight weeks in Vienna when
the master wrote to Bonn, "I must now give up all
great works to him [Beethoven], and soon cease composing."</p>

<p>The harmony, however, which at first existed between
Haydn and his pupil was soon disturbed. The
former seems to have been always pleased with the
work executed by Beethoven, who, on the contrary,
was very much dissatisfied with the instruction given
by the master. He was obliged, in this instance, to
make the same experience that he had formerly
confided to Junker, at Mergentheim, regarding pianoforte
players, viz., that he had seldom found what he
believed himself entitled to expect. Distance lends
enchantment to the view; and the keen, striving
worker soon discovered that Haydn was not the
profound, earnest thinker that his longing fancy had
painted in Bonn.</p>

<p>But an unexpected help was at hand. One day as
he was returning from his lesson at Haydn's house,
his portfolio under his arm, he met a friend whose
acquaintance he had only recently made, but with
whom he was already on intimate terms&mdash;Johann
Schenk, a thorough and scholarly musician, afterwards
well known as the composer of the "Dorf<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>barbier," and one of the most amiable of men. To
him Beethoven confided his troubles, bitterly lamenting
the slow progress his knowledge of counterpoint
made under Haydn's guidance. Somewhat
astounded, Schenk examined the compositions in
Beethoven's portfolio, and discovered many faults
which had been passed over without correction.</p>

<p>Haydn's conduct in this instance has never been
explained. Generally conscientious in the discharge
of his duties as an instructor, this carelessness must
have arisen either from a pressure of work, or from
some undefined feeling with regard to Beethoven,
which prompted him to give him as little assistance
as possible. The latter supposition is hardly compatible
with the terms in which he wrote of his pupil
to Bonn, but Beethoven could never shake off the
idea that Haydn did not mean well by him&mdash;a suspicion
which was strengthened by what afterwards
occurred.</p>

<p>Excessively irritated by Schenk's discovery, Beethoven
would have gone on the impulse of the moment
to reproach Haydn and break off all connection with
him. Schenk, however, who had early perceived
Beethoven's worth, succeeded in calming him, promising
him all the assistance in his power, and pointing
out the folly of a course which would inevitably
have led to the withdrawal of the pension from Max
Franz, who would naturally have disbelieved any
complaint against the greatest master of the day,
and have attributed Beethoven's conduct to wrong
motives. The young man had the sense to perceive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
the justice of these remarks, and continued to bring
his work to Haydn (Schenk always giving it a strict
revisal) until the latter's journey to England in 1794
afforded a feasible opportunity of providing himself
with a better teacher.</p>

<p>Thus, although neither cordially liked the other, a
tolerable appearance of friendship was maintained.
It was, perhaps, impossible that, between two such
totally different natures the connection could have
been otherwise. Haydn was genial and affable;
from his long contest with poverty, rather obsequious;
not apt to take offence or to imagine slights; ready
to render unto C&aelig;sar his due; in short, a courtier.</p>

<p>What greater contrast to all this can be imagined
than our proud, reserved, brusque Beethoven? <i>He</i>
pay court to princes, or wait with "bated breath"
upon their whims! He, the stormy republican, who
regarded all men as on the same level, and would
bow to nothing less than the Divine in man!</p>

<p>Haydn, who had laughingly bestowed on him the
title of the "Great Mogul," probably felt that there
was no real sympathy, or possibility of such a feeling,
between them. Nevertheless, as we have said, they
continued to outward seeming friends, though Beethoven's
suspicions would not allow him to accept
Haydn's offer of taking him to London. He accompanied
him, however, in the summer to Eisenstadt,
the residence of Prince Esterhazy, Haydn's
patron, and on this occasion left the following note
for Schenk, which shows the friendly feeling existing
between them:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Schenk</span>,&mdash;I did not know that I should
set off to-day for Eisenstadt. I should like much to
have spoken once more to you. Meanwhile, depend
upon my gratitude for the kindnesses you have shown
me. I shall endeavour, so far as is in my power, to
requite you.</p>

<p>"I hope to see you soon again, and to enjoy the
pleasure of your society. Farewell, and don't quite
forget</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:30em;">"Your <span class="smcap">Beethoven</span>."</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>One of Beethoven's peculiarities may as well be
referred to here in passing. Although living in the
same town with many of his friends&mdash;nay, within a
few minutes walk of them,&mdash;years would elapse without
their coming in contact, unless they continually
presented themselves to his notice, and so <i>would</i> not
let themselves be forgotten. Absorbed in his creations,
the master lived in a world of his own; consequently,
many little circumstances in his career, in
reality proceeding from this abstraction, were at the
time attributed to very different motives.</p>

<p>His connection with Schenk is an instance of this.
Though both inhabited Vienna, they had not met for
many years, when in 1824 Beethoven and his friend
Schindler encountered Schenk&mdash;then almost seventy
years of age&mdash;in the street. If his old teacher had
spent the intervening years in another world, and
suddenly alighted from the clouds, Beethoven could
not have been more surprised and delighted. To
drag him into the quietest corner of the "J&auml;gerhorn"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
(a tavern close at hand) was the work of a moment,
and there for hours the old friends mutually compared
notes, and reviewed the ups and downs of fortune
that had befallen them since the days when the Great
Mogul used to storm Schenk's lodgings and abuse
his master. When they parted it was in tears, never
to meet again.</p>

<p>The opportune departure of Haydn allowed Beethoven
to place himself under the instruction of Albrechtsberger,
the cathedral organist. This man,
who counted among his pupils not only Beethoven,
but Hummel and Seyfried, was a walking treatise on
counterpoint; but far from investing the science with
any life or brightness, it was his delight to render it,
if possible, more austere and stringent than he had
found it, and to lay down rules which to a fiery, impulsive
nature were positively unbearable. Nevertheless,
Pegasus can go in harness if need be. Beethoven,
who, like every true genius, was essentially
modest in his estimate of himself, and had already
felt the want of a thoroughly grounded knowledge,
submitted to Albrechtsberger's routine for a period
of about fifteen months&mdash;beginning almost at the
elements of the science, and working out the dry-as-dust
themes in his master's Gradus ad Parnassum,
until he had gained for himself an insight into the
mysteries of fugue and canon.</p>

<p>This is not the commonly received notion of Beethoven's
student-days. Ries in his "Notices" has the
following:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I knew them all well [<i>i.e.</i>, Haydn, Albrechts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>berger, and Salieri, who gave Beethoven instruction
in writing for the voice]; all three appreciated Beethoven
highly, but were all of <i>one</i> opinion regarding
his studies. Each said Beethoven was always so
obstinate and self-willed that he had afterwards much
to learn through his own hard experience, which he
would not accept in earlier days as the subject of instruction.
Albrechtsberger and Salieri especially were
of this opinion."</p>

<p>But this testimony ought not to be accepted for
more than it is worth. Haydn, absorbed in his own
pursuits, and utterly unable to fathom Beethoven's
nature&mdash;the very reverse of his own; Albrechtsberger,
the formal contrapuntist, far more concerned
about the outside of the cup, the form of a composition,
than about its contents; Salieri, the superficial
composer of a few trashy operas long since forgotten,&mdash;how
were these men competent to pass
judgment on a <i>Feuerkopf</i> like Beethoven?</p>

<p>A little further examination of the question in the
light of recent researches will enable the reader to
judge for himself whether the master was an earnest,
willing student, or not.</p>

<p>Until very lately, the main source whence biographers
drew their accounts of the <i>Lehrjahre</i> was
the work published by the Chevalier von Seyfried,
which purported to be a correct transcription of
Beethoven's "Studies in Thorough-bass." This
volume, as given to the world, was garnished with
a number of sarcastic annotations, professedly
emanating from Beethoven himself, wherein the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
theoretical rule under consideration at the moment
is held up to ridicule. It is this circumstance, coupled
with the assertion of Ries above alluded to, which
has chiefly produced the prevalent impression regarding
Beethoven as a student. We suppose that
nine readers out of ten will have pictured to themselves
the master receiving instruction in much the
same spirit as that in which he was wont to give it
in Bonn, namely, like the rebellious colt described by
Wegeler!&mdash;Now what are the real facts of the case?&mdash;Thanks
to the unwearied exertions of Gustav
Nottebohm, we are in a position to answer the
question. In his admirable book, "Beethoven's
Studien," the <i>actual</i> work done by Beethoven under
Haydn and Albrechtsberger is at length laid before
the public, and the falsity of Seyfried's compilation
fully proved.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Nottebohm has no hesitation in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
affirming that Beethoven was a willing rather than a
mutinous scholar, and that he was always intent on
his subject, and strove hard to obtain a clear conception
of it.</p>

<p>As for the "sarcastic" marginal remarks which
for nearly half a century have been treasured up
and smiled over by every admirer of the master
as eminently "characteristic" of him, will the
reader believe that they turn out to be characteristic
of&mdash;nothing but the unblushing impudence
of Kapellmeister Ritter von Seyfried? They
have no existence except in his imagination. The
running commentary which accompanies the exercises
is of a very different description from that
supplied by him; it contains one instance, and one
only, of an ironical tendency, and this is amusing
enough in its simplicity to have extorted a smile from
Albrechtsberger himself. One of the text-books employed
appears to have been that of T&uuml;rk, who
makes use of the term "<i>galant</i>" to designate the
<i>free</i> as opposed to the <i>strict</i> style of composition.
Now what Beethoven saw lurking beneath the title
<i>galant</i>, or what stumblingblock it presented to him,
is hard to discover; but we find the expression, as often
as it occurs, invariably altered to one that suits his
notions better; and once he breaks out with, "Laugh,
friends, at this <i>galanterie</i>!" Perhaps we may arrive
at an appreciation of his distaste to the phrase, if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
we translate it by the word <i>genteel</i>,&mdash;imagine Beethoven
writing in a <i>genteel</i> style!!</p>

<p>But in addition to thus clearing away the haze of
misapprehension that had settled round our master's
character as a learner, the efforts of Thayer and
Nottebohm have also thrown much light on two
questions which have proved more or less perplexing
to all students, and to the brief consideration of which
we would now ask the reader's attention.</p>

<p>First, then, how is it that Beethoven's genius as a
composer was so late, comparatively speaking, in
developing? At the time of his arrival in Vienna
he was in his twenty-second year, and before that age
Mozart, as we know, had produced no less than
293 works. Yet our master passed his boyhood
in an atmosphere where every influence tended to
quicken the musical life, and to hasten, rather than
retard, its growth. Are we to take the handful of
works&mdash;the little sonatas, the crude preludes, and
other trifles generally recognised as composed in Bonn,
to be the sole outcome of that period? Impossible!
Alexander Thayer may fairly be said to have
solved the problem by a single reference to chronology.
He finds that between the years 1795-1802 (that is, a
period <i>commencing immediately after the conclusion of
his studies</i>) Beethoven published no fewer than
ninety-two works, many of them of the first magnitude,
including two symphonies, an oratorio, three
concertos, nine trios, thirty-two sonatas, with and
without accompaniment&mdash;and this during a time
when his leisure for composition must have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
scant indeed. We find him in these years incessantly
occupied in more mechanical work, teaching,
perfecting his style as a pianoforte virtuoso, travelling,
continuing his studies with Salieri, and, in addition,
enjoying life as he went along, not burying himself
hermit-wise in his works, as was the case at a
later date. Moreover, in Thayer's words: "Precisely
at the time when he began to devote himself
<i>exclusively</i> to composition, this wondrous fertility
suddenly ceased. The solution lies on the surface"
viz., that many, if not most, of these works were
actually composed in Bonn, and deliberately kept
back by the author for a certain time. "Why?"
we ask; "on what account?" "Until he had
attained, by study and observation, to the <i>certainty</i>
that he stood on the firm basis of a thoroughly-grounded
knowledge," replies Thayer, Beethoven
would give nothing to the world. That goal reached,
the creations of his youthful fancy are taken in hand
again one by one; the critical file, guided by the
"dictates of an enlightened judgment," is faithfully
applied, and the composition, bearing the final
<i>imprimatur</i> of its author's satisfaction, launched to
meet its fate. Well might Beethoven laugh securely
at his critics!&mdash;he had been beforehand with them&mdash;he
had sat in judgment on himself.</p>

<p>This view receives ample confirmation in the
newly published version of the "Studies." The
reader may reasonably take objection to the foregoing,
and may inquire: "Was not Beethoven, then,
master of the mere technicalities of composition by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
the time he reached Vienna? He had been engaged
in studying the theory as well as the practice of
music for over ten years, under a master, himself
well known as a composer."&mdash;Let us hear Nottebohm
on the point. The instruction imparted by Neefe,
although calculated to be eminently helpful as
regards "the formation of taste and the development
of musical feeling," was yet "from a technical
standpoint unsatisfactory," being based, not on the
strict contrapuntal system of the early ecclesiastical
writers (the system which alone offers the necessary
<i>discipline</i> for the composer), but rather on the lighter
and more superficial method of the <i>new</i> Leipzig
school, of which Johann Adam Hiller, Neefe's
master and model, was one of the leading exponents.</p>

<p>Beethoven seems to have divined intuitively
where his weakness lay. For the radical defect
which he recognised in his training there was but
one remedy, viz., to lay aside preconceived opinion;
to go back in all humility to the very <i>Urquelle</i>,
the Fountain-head, of Harmony, and trace out thence
for himself, slowly and painfully, the eternal channel
of <span class="smcap">LAW</span>, <i>within</i> which the mighty sound-flood may
roll and toss at will, but <i>beyond</i> whose bounds,
immutable and fixed, no mortal power may send it
with impunity.</p>

<p>Turning to the "Studies," we find no trace of a
disposition to claim exemption from toil on the score
of genius. On the contrary!&mdash;commencing at the
very foundation (the names of the different intervals),
every branch of composition is taken up in its turn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>&mdash;simple,
double, and triple counterpoint in all detail&mdash;and
worked at with a will (several of the exercises,
being written and rewritten two or three times),
until we arrive at Fugue, where, for a reason shortly
to be noted, there is a halt.</p>

<p>What shall we say to the picture thus presented
to us?&mdash;A young man self-willed and impatient
by nature, at an age when submission to direct instruction
is, to say the least, unpalatable, voluntarily
placing himself under the yoke&mdash;a poet, within
whose soul divine melodies plead for freedom, and
thoughts of fire press hard for utterance, resolutely
keeping inspiration under, until he shall have penetrated
into the structure of language&mdash;a painter, in
whose desk lie sketches, marvellous in freshness,
vigour, and originality, occupying himself for weary
months in the study of anatomy! Truly our Beethoven
at this period, as at a later, comes well within
the practical definition of Genius; his "capacity
for painstaking" was "infinite." Not so, however,
his patience, as we shall presently see.</p>

<p>Now for the second difficulty to which Nottebohm
has found a clue: how is it that in Beethoven's
earlier works we have so few instances of fugue-writing&mdash;at
the time one of the most favoured
styles of composition; and that these, when they do
occur, should from the irregularity of their construction
invariably be disappointing? Here again the
scholarship of our critic has done good service. His
minute examination of the exercises done under
Albrechtsberger has led him to the conclusion, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
to the faulty teaching of the master is due the
faulty workmanship of the pupil&mdash;a somewhat
astounding discovery when we remember the high
estimation in which the contrapuntist was held by
his contemporaries. The fact remains, however, that
the instruction given by Albrechtsberger, "in several
important details of fugue building, was deficient
and not grounded;" hence, in all probability, the
rarity of fugue during the first ten years of
Beethoven's creative activity. He had not entire
mastery over its resources, and therefore hesitated
to introduce it, save in a subordinate and fitful way.
We may be surprised that the indoctrination in
the works of J.S. Bach, which we noted in the
Bonn days, should not of itself have been powerful
enough imperceptibly to mould his style. There is,
however, no trace of this at the period we are
considering. That the influence of the <i>Urvater</i><a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> of
harmony (a title applied by Beethoven himself to
John Sebastian) worked deeply into his inner life,
there can be no doubt; but its effects were not
<i>apparent</i> till a very much later date&mdash;a phenomenon,
to our thinking, only to be explained on psychological
grounds.</p>

<p>To return. Beethoven's patience, which had held
out over two years, comes to a sudden halt on this very
question. Clear-sighted and tolerant of no incompetence,
our young "Thorough!" seems to have detected
Albrechtsberger's weak point, and there and then to
have cast off allegiance to him. The exercises up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
to fugue are, generally speaking, most carefully
executed. No sooner, however, does the scholar
perceive that the master is almost as much "at sea"
as himself, and steering vaguely without a chart,
than docility is at an end; he conceives an intense
disgust for the theoretical tread-mill; growls to a
friend that he has "had enough of making musical
skeletons!" and absolves himself, without permission,
from the remainder of Albrechtsberger's course.</p>

<p>We hear the old Theoretiker long after this grimly
warning one of his pupils against his <i>ci-devant</i> scholar:
"Have nothing to do with him. <i>He</i> never learned
anything!" "Nay," Beethoven might have replied,
had he thought it worth his while, "I learned <i>all</i>
that <i>you</i> had to teach. Would you have had me
walk with my eyes shut?" As Nottebohm remarks
"the one <i>could</i> not" teach, "the other <i>would</i> not"
learn, and so the instruction came to a close,
and Beethoven fell back upon his own resources.</p>

<p>He had, however, by this time achieved his purpose
in the main. He had probed and examined
the received theoretical axioms, and was in a position
to decide for himself as to their actual importance.
Henceforth none were accepted by him as imperative,
simply out of deference to current ideas, and thus we
find instances again and again of an inflexible
determination to shake off all restraints, the utility
of which was not recognised by his inner consciousness.
He was wont in after years, when told of any
perplexity of the critics, to rub his hands together in
glee, saying; "Yes, yes! they are all astonished, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
put their heads together, because&mdash;they don't find it
in any thorough-bass book!"</p>

<p>That independence may easily be merged in self-will,
however, he sometimes proved to demonstration,
to the delight of those who were on the watch for
flaws. Ries tells us, for instance, that on one
occasion he discovered and pointed out (in the C
minor quartet, Op. 18) two perfect fifths in succession.
"Well?" asks the master, testily, "and who has forbidden
them?" Somewhat taken aback, the scholar
keeps silence. Again the question is repeated. "But
it is a first principle!" hesitates Ries in astonishment.
"<span class="smcap">Who has forbidden them?</span>" thunders out the
master again. "Marpurg, Kirnberger. Fux,&mdash;all
the theorists." "<span class="smcap">And I allow them!</span>" is the
conclusion. But the obstinacy displayed in this and
similar anecdotes is more an expression of petulance,
than of preconsidered judgment. Beethoven, as we
know, enjoyed nothing better than an opportunity of
mystifying certain individuals as to his real thoughts
and intentions. Occasionally we hear his true voice
in the matter. A friend had remarked, regarding
the second and third "Leonora" overtures, "The artist
must create in freedom, only giving in to the spirit
of his age, and be monarch over his own materials;
under such conditions alone will true art-works come
to light." "Granted," replied Beethoven; "but he must
<i>not</i> give in to the spirit of his age, otherwise it is all
over with originality.... Had I written them
[the two overtures] in the spirit that prevailed at
the time, they would certainly have been understood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
at once, as, for example, the 'Storm of Kotzeluch.'
But I cannot cut and carve out my works according
to the fashion, as they would fain have me do.
Freshness and originality create themselves, without
thinking about it."</p>

<p>After all, let us remember that it is vain to measure
the strides of a giant with the footsteps of ordinary
men. Epoch-Makers are necessarily Law-Breakers
to the eyes of their contemporaries. Years must pass
before the import of their work is fully discerned.
Reverting to our former simile, <i>we</i> can see that while
Beethoven's critics believed him to be rebelliously
diverting the current of Harmony from the pure course
directed by a Palestrina, a Bach, a Handel, a Haydn,
a Mozart, he was in reality simply engaged in deepening
and widening its channel, that the Stream might
flow on in grander and nobler proportions to meet
the ever-growing necessities of Humanity.</p>

<p>Beethoven continued a diligent student through
life; from those who had devoted special attention
to any particular subject he was always eager to learn,
although, as we have seen, without pledging himself
to follow their views. Thus we find him in 1799
studying the art of quartet-writing more closely with
F&ouml;rster, who excelled in that branch of composition;
and as late as 1809 he styles himself the "pupil" of
Salieri, from whom, as the friend of Metastasio, and
versed in the requirements of the Italian school, he
often sought advice in his vocal compositions.</p>

<p>But in addition to more purely theoretic studies, Beethoven
was indefatigable in his practical investigations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
into the nature and capabilities of the instruments
for which he wrote, and which his creative genius
roused to unheard-of achievements. From Herren
Kraft and Linke he learned the mechanism of the
violoncello; Punto taught him that of the horn, and
Friedlowsky that of the clarionet. He often consulted
these artists in after life regarding the suitability of
certain passages for their respective instruments,
and allowed himself to be guided by their suggestions.</p>

<p>Far otherwise was it, however, with singers; for
them Beethoven composed as he liked, without
humouring any little predilection of the most fascinating
prima donna, or introducing a single piece for
display (one reason why Rossini was able for so long
to play the part of the successful rival). On the
other hand, the singers had their revenge, and sang
his music precisely as they listed, interpolating embellishments
and cadenze <i>a piacere</i> without the
slightest regard to his wishes.</p>

<p>The following letters to Eleanore van Breuning
belong to this epoch:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span style="margin-left:30em;">"<i>Vienna, Nov. 2nd, '93.</i></span>
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Most esteemed Eleanore! my dearest
Friend!</span>&mdash;A whole year of my residence in the
capital has nearly elapsed without your having received
a letter from me, notwithstanding you have been
continually with me in the liveliest remembrance. I
have often entertained myself with the thought of
you and your dear family, but oftener still I have not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>enjoyed the peace in doing so which I could have
wished.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>"At such times that fatal dispute hovered before
me, and my conduct in the matter appeared to me
detestable. But it was past and gone. How much
would I give to be able to obliterate entirely from
my life the way in which I then acted! so dishonouring
to me, so opposed to my general character.
At the same time there were many circumstances
which tended to keep us apart, and I suspect that
what specially hindered a reconciliation was the
manner in which the remarks of each were repeated
to the other. We both believed that what we said
was the result of honest conviction, when in reality it
proceeded from anger inflamed by others, and so we
were both deceived. Your good and noble character,
my dear friend, warrants me in believing that you
have long since forgiven me; but they say that the
truest repentance is that in which we confess our own
faults, and this is what I desire to do. And let us
now draw the curtain over the whole affair, only
extracting the lesson from it that when a dispute
happens between friends, it is always better that no
mediator should be employed, but that friend should
address himself direct to friend.</p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>"You will receive along with this a dedication,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
and I can only wish that it were greater and more
worthy of you. They teased me here into publishing
this little work, and I avail myself of the opportunity
to give you, my esteemed Eleanore, a proof of my
regard and friendship for yourself, and a token of my
lasting remembrance of your house. Accept this
trifle, and think of it as coming from a devoted friend.
Oh! if it only gives you pleasure, my wishes will be
quite satisfied. May it be a little reawakening of the
time when I passed so many happy hours in your
house! perhaps it may keep you in remembrance of
me until I return again, which certainly will not
happen soon. Oh! my dear friend, how we shall
rejoice then! You will find your friend a more
cheerful man, with all the former furrows of adversity
chased away through time and a happier lot.</p>

<p>"If you should see B. Koch, I beg you to tell her
that it is unkind of her not to have written me
even once. I have written to her twice, and to Malchus<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
three times&mdash;but no answer. Tell her that if
she will not write herself, she might, at least, urge
Malchus to do so.</p>

<p>"In concluding my letter, I venture one more
request, namely, that it would make me very happy
to possess an Angola vest knitted by your hands, my
dear friend. Forgive this not very modest demand!
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>It arises out of my great predilection for everything
made by you; but I must tell you confidentially that
there is also a little vanity connected with it. I want
to be able to say that I possess something of one of
the best and most admired girls in Bonn. I have, it
is true, still the first which you kindly gave me in
Bonn, but it has become so old-fashioned that I can
only treasure it up in my wardrobe as something of
yours, very dear to me. You would delight me much
by favouring me soon with one of your kind letters.
Should mine give you any pleasure, I promise you
certainly, so far as lies in my power, to continue
them; since everything is welcome to me whereby I
may prove to you how much I am,</p>

</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;You will find the v. [variations] somewhat
difficult to play, especially the shake in the coda;
but don't let this alarm you, since it is so arranged
that you have nothing to do but the shake; the other
notes you may leave out, as they occur in the violin
part. I would never have written in this manner
had I not had occasion to remark that there are
several people here in V., who, after I have extemporized
of an evening, write down many of my peculiarities
next day, and pass them off as their own.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> As I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>foresaw that such things would soon be published,
it occurred to me to anticipate their movements.
Another reason was also&mdash;to perplex the pianoforte
teachers here. Many of them are my mortal enemies,
and I wished to revenge myself on them in this way;
knowing that they would occasionally be asked to
play the variations, when these gentlemen would
come out in rather an unfavourable light."</p></div>

<p>The following fragment is without date:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The beautiful cravat, worked by your own hands,
has caused me the greatest possible surprise. Although
in itself so pleasing, it awakened within me
feelings of melancholy. Its effect was to recall the
past, and to shame me by your generous behaviour.
In truth, I did not think that you still considered me
worthy of remembrance.</p>

<p>"Oh! could you have been a witness of my emotions
yesterday when it arrived, you would not think
I exaggerate in saying that the recollection of you
brings the tears to my eyes, and makes me very sad.
However little I may deserve credit in your eyes, I
beg you to believe, <i>my friend</i> (allow me still to call
you so), that I have suffered and still suffer through
the loss of your friendship. You and your dear
mother I shall never forget. Your goodness to me
was such that the loss of you neither can nor will be
easily replaced. I know what I lost and what you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>were to me, but&mdash;&mdash;if I attempt to fill up this blank,
I must refer to scenes which are as unpleasant for
you to hear as for me to describe.</p>

<p>"As a slight return for your kind remembrance of
me, I take the liberty of sending you some variations,
and the rondo with violin accompaniment. I have a
great deal to do, or I would have copied the long-promised
sonata for you. In my manuscript it is
little better than a sketch, and it would be very difficult
for Paraquin himself,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> clever as he is, to transcribe
it. You can have the rondo copied, and then return
the score to me. It is the only one of all my compositions
suitable for you, and as you are shortly going
to Kerpen,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> I thought it might afford you some
pleasure.</p>

<p>"Farewell, my friend. It is impossible for me to
call you by any other name, however indifferent I
may be to you. Pray believe that I reverence you
and your mother as highly as formerly.</p>

<p>"If it is in my power to contribute anything to
your happiness, pray do not fail to let me know, since
it is the only means left to me of proving my gratitude
for past friendship.</p>

<p>"May you have a pleasant journey, and bring your
dear mother back in perfect health!</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> The origin of this work may not be uninteresting to the reader.
It is briefly as follows. Among the effects of Beethoven offered for
sale at the public auction of 1827 were five packets of MSS., labelled
"Exercises in Composition." These were bought by the publisher, T.
Haslinger, in the not unreasonable belief that they would be found to
present a complete view of the preparation made by the master for his
life's work. He determined to give the collection to the world, and
entrusted the editing of it to the Chevalier von Seyfried, as a friend of
Beethoven and himself a scholarly musician. In process of time the
volume appeared, and was received with very opposite sentiments by different
sections of the public: by some it was accepted as genuine; by others
rejected as a fabrication. Nottebohm's investigation has proved the
truth to lie between the two extremes. "Seyfried's book," he says, "is
neither authentic nor forged; it is a <i>falsified</i> work." Seyfried, in fact,
seems to have gone to work with incredible recklessness; his "Beethoven's
Studies" is an <i>Olla Podrida</i>, composed of not only Beethoven's own
exercises (put together without regard to natural sequence or chronology),
but of another theoretical course, probably that prepared by Beethoven
years after for the instruction of the Archduke Rudolph; while a third
element is actually introduced in the shape of Studies from a MS. written
in a strange hand, and possibly the work of another pupil of Albrechtsberger!</p></div>

When his fiery nature had led him into saying or doing anything which

remorse knew no bounds. Wegeler declares that his contrition was

</div>
<p>eethoven's period of study embraced
over two years, during which many events
took place that produced a revolution in his
circumstances, and left him at their close in a very
different position from that in which they had found
him.</p>

<p>The first of these was the death of his father, which
happened about a month after his arrival in Vienna,
obliged the young man to take upon himself once
more the duties of guardian to his two brothers, and
necessitated the following petition to the Elector:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Most Reverend and Gracious Prince</span>,&mdash;Some
years ago your Highness was pleased to grant
a pension to my father, the court tenor Van Beethoven,
and graciously to decree that one hundred thalers of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>his salary should be placed in my hands, that I might
provide for the clothing, maintenance, and education
of my two younger brothers, and also discharge the
debts contracted by our father. I wished at once to
present this order to your Highness's treasurer; but
my father earnestly implored me not to do so, that it
might not be imagined he was incapable of superintending
his own family; and he further added that he
would himself pay me quarterly the twenty-five R.
thalers, which up to the present time was faithfully
performed.</p>

<p>"After his death, however (in December last), when
I wished to avail myself of your Highness's kindness
and present the above-mentioned order, I was alarmed
by the discovery that my father had made away
with it.</p>

<p>"With all dutiful respect I therefore beg your
Serene Highness kindly to renew this order, and to
instruct your treasurer to let me have the last quarter
of this gracious addition to my salary (due the beginning
of February).</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:20em;">"Your Serene Highness's<br /></span>
<span style="margin-left:22em;">"Most obedient and faithful Servant,<br /></span>
<span style="margin-left:25em;" class="smcap">"Lud. v. Beethoven</span>, <i>Court Organist</i>."
</p></div>

<p>This request was granted, and Franz Ries undertook
the management of the money; but after June,
1793, not only this but the pension granted to Beethoven
himself was suddenly stopped. The fruits of
the French Revolution had made themselves apparent,
and the Elector was forced to fly from Bonn and take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
refuge in Mergentheim. Henceforth, Beethoven must
depend upon himself.</p>

<p>Luckily the emergency found him prepared; he
was already esteemed as one of the best pianoforte
players of the day&mdash;nay, there were not wanting
those who assigned to him the very first place. The
recommendation of Count Waldstein, who was nearly
related to more than half a dozen of the best families
in Austria, coupled with that of the elector (uncle to
the reigning emperor), together with the fact that he
was Haydn's most promising pupil, gained for the
young man admission to the highest circles in the
capital, where his extraordinary abilities speedily
met with recognition, and placed him above all fear
of want.</p>

<p>In accounting for the peculiar facility with which
Beethoven obtained a hearing in Vienna, the state of
society and position of art at the period must not be
forgotten.</p>

<p>In a wide sense, and as we should understand it
now, music was not universally cultivated or appreciated.
The opera houses were two in number, one
entirely given up to Italian performances; the other
plain and unattractive, struggling under great disadvantages
to bring forward native composers.</p>

<p>Church music was at a low ebb; the influence of
Albrechtsberger at the cathedral not tending to much
life or novelty in that branch of composition.</p>

<p>Public concerts, such as are now of daily occurrence,
happened perhaps once a year, when funds were
required for some charity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus, music was not then the universal pursuit of
all classes. The enjoyment of it was almost entirely
limited to the privileged few&mdash;the aristocracy&mdash;who,
following the example set by the reigning family,
professed an adoration of the art, a devotion to it,
which (though, of course, in many instances genuine)
was so general, so common, as to cast a doubt upon
its reality. Music was, in short, the fashionable
rage; to be non-musical was to shut oneself out of
the pale of society&mdash;an alternative not to be thought
of without shuddering by the gay, pleasure-loving
Viennese.</p>

<p>Accordingly the musical enthusiasm was wonderful.
We find no less than ten private theatres, each with
its full corps of actors and actresses, at most of which
operettas were performed; and an orchestral society,
composed exclusively of members of noble houses,
who gave public concerts, open only to their equals
in society, at the unwonted hour of six in the
morning.</p>

<p>In addition to these, every nobleman had his private
orchestra, or his <i>Quartettistes</i>, or, if his means would
not admit of this, at least one eminent instrumental
player, attached to his household. As all the great
families of Austria vied with each other in the splendour
and <i>recherch&eacute;</i> style of their musical entertainments,
it may easily be imagined how, in such a state
of society, Beethoven was lionized, petted, and f&ecirc;ted.</p>

<p>Thayer gives a list of no fewer than thirty-one
great houses (nine of them belonging to princes)
which must have been open to him, as the owners<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
were all recognised, worthy dilettanti in the highest
sense&mdash;not mere followers of the fickle goddess,
Fashion. Add to these the crowd that is ever ready
to patronize him whom the leaders of <i>ton</i> have taken
by the hand, and we see that Beethoven could not
have wanted either for pupils or for opportunities of
playing at private concerts.</p>

<p>It was, doubtless, the bustle and pressure of this
episode in his life, the contact with vulgarity in high
places, that gave him the dislike he afterwards manifested
to playing in public. At an earlier period in
Bonn, as we have seen, it was his delight to communicate
his ideas to others, and to pour forth the
inmost feelings of his soul in the presence of a little
circle of sympathising, cultivated listeners. But here,
in Vienna, to play at the command of some birth-proud
aristocrat, who regarded art and artists as
mere ministers to his pleasure&mdash;from such a task
Beethoven's mind revolted. Wegeler relates the
effect which such an occurrence would have upon
him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"An invitation to play in society robbed him of all
gaiety. He would come to me gloomy and down-cast,
complaining that he was forced to play till the
blood tingled to his very finger tips. By degrees we
would begin to talk together in a friendly way, when
I sought to distract his thoughts and to soothe him.
When this end was achieved, I let the conversation
drop. I placed myself at my desk, and if Beethoven
wished to speak to me again, he was obliged to
seat himself on a chair before the pianoforte. Soon,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
and often without turning, he would strike a few
undecided chords, out of which the most beautiful
melodies were gradually developed. I dared not
hazard a remark about his playing, or only allude to
it <i>en passant</i>. Beethoven would go away quite cheerful,
and always return willingly to me. The dislike,
however, remained, and was often the occasion of
a rupture between him and his best friends."</p>

<p>But the halcyon days had not yet arrived when the
great tone-poet could devote himself entirely to his
life-mission. His own wants and those of his brothers
had to be provided for, and accordingly the round
of pianoforte-playing was gone through, as that of
teaching had been before, and with the same result,
it paved the way to life-friendships.</p>

<p>Amongst the distinct leaders of the musical taste
of the capital was Gottfried, Baron van Swieten, the
son of Maria Theresa's Dutch physician, and the
composer of twelve symphonies (on which Haydn's
verdict was&mdash;"as stiff as himself.") He had formerly
passed some time in Berlin, where he had become
acquainted with Friedemann and Emanuel Bach, and
had heard the "Messiah," "Judas Maccab&aelig;us," and
"Alexander's Feast." After his return to Vienna, he
acted as secretary to a musical society which met at
his house, where the great works of Bach, Handel,
and the old Italian writers (including Palestrina), were
devotedly studied. Mozart's co-operation in this undertaking
had been invaluable; but Mozart was gone,
and Van Swieten was inconsolable for his loss until
he discovered Beethoven. He was a quaint type of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
a race long extinct&mdash;the genuine old <i>kenner</i> or
connoisseur. One can almost see him, when at a
concert an incautious whisper was heard in the background,
rising majestically from his place, and conspicuous
from his great height, taking an awful survey
of the room to discover the offender and wither him
by a glance! In his efforts after the <i>true</i> in art,
however, no very marked line was discernible to him
between the sublime and the ridiculous; hence the
earnestness with which he persuaded Haydn (and for
which the latter never forgave him) to insert the
croaking of the frogs in the Seasons. But take him
for all in all, he was a valuable friend to Beethoven,
and as such the latter regarded him. A carefully
preserved note of his is still extant: "If nothing
comes in the way, I should like to see you here next
Wednesday, at half-past eight o'clock, with your
nightcap in your pocket."</p>

<p>The latter precaution was not unnecessary, for the
insatiable host (after the evening's entertainment was
over and the guests gone home) would not consent
to release his young <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> under at least half-a-dozen
of Bach's fugues for a "good-night," or "<i>evening
blessing</i>," as he was wont to call it.</p>

<p>Most valuable were the evenings spent in Van
Swieten's house to Beethoven, for here he was first
made fully acquainted with the majesty of Handel,
"that unequalled master of all masters," in Beethoven's
estimation, of whom he once said: "Go, and learn
of him how to produce, with small means, such great
effects!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>Another patron of the young musician, and one
able to benefit him more substantially, was the
Prince Karl Lichnowski, the accomplished pupil of
Mozart, who, with his amiable wife Christiane,
devoted every leisure hour to artistic pursuits. This
couple, worthy in all respects of their exalted rank,
at first attracted by the wonderful improvisation of
Haydn's pupil, soon discovered, on a more intimate
acquaintance, the true nobility of soul and dazzling
genius which lay beneath the rough exterior.</p>

<p>They were childless; with the utmost delicacy it
was proposed to Beethoven in 1794 that he should
come to them; he accepted the offer in the spirit in
which it was made, and for several years was an
inmate of the Lichnowski Palace, treated with more
than parental tenderness by the Prince and Princess.
The latter took the place of Madame von Breuning,
and Beethoven used afterwards to say laughingly,
"They wanted to train me there with <i>grandmotherly</i>
love; and the Princess Christiane would have liked
to put a glass case over me, so that no evil might
come nigh me."</p>

<p>Not that there was never any misunderstanding
between Beethoven and his patron; on the contrary,
the Princess had very often to mediate between them.
How could it be otherwise? it was not easy for the
powerful, impulsive mind of Beethoven, with his previous
training, to accommodate itself to the smooth,
etiquette-trammelled life of a palace. To abide by a
settled routine was to him impossible; and after
a few ineffectual struggles the attempt to make him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
do so was abandoned, and the artist left free to
develop himself in his own way.</p>

<p>Wegeler relates that when he came to Vienna he
found Beethoven installed in the Lichnowski Palace,
but by no means so content with his position as one
would imagine. Amongst other things he complained
to him that the Prince's dinner-hour was fixed at four
o'clock. "Now," said he, "I ought to be at home by
half-past three to dress and trim my beard, &amp;c. I
could not stand that!" So some restaurant was
more frequently honoured by his presence than the
Lichnowski dinner-table.</p>

<p>It must not be thought that Beethoven forfeited
any of his independence by thus becoming an inmate
of the palace. On the contrary, he knew well, and
the Prince did also, that the advantage was mutual.
If he had a zealous and wealthy patron, the Prince
had in return the benefit of the constant presence of
the first pianist and improvisatore of the day at all
his <i>Musikabende</i>, besides the <i>&eacute;clat</i> attached to the fact
that so many of the composer's productions were first
performed at his house. Not that either of them
ever coolly balanced the one set of advantages
over against the other. This was in point of fact the
relation between them; in reality it was more like
that of father and son.</p>

<p>The critical judgment of the Prince was highly
esteemed by Beethoven, who often allowed himself to
be persuaded by him into making alterations which
no other influence had power to effect; and his proficiency
as a pianoforte-player, which enabled him to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
master with comparative ease the difficulties in the
new style inaugurated by his <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>, confirmed
Beethoven in his own views, and gave him fresh
strength to resist those who would have had him
adopt a more simple manner of writing.</p>

<p>Beethoven's independence of thought and action
was of vital importance in his development. "Help
thyself!" was his motto. But we are sometimes
inclined to smile at the lengths to which he carried
his favourite doctrine. For instance, having overheard
the prince (who had a peculiarly loud voice)
direct his J&auml;ger, that whenever Beethoven and he
rang at the same time, the latter should be waited on
first; he took care that very day to procure a servant
for himself. Another time, when he had a great
desire to learn riding, and the Prince's stud had been
placed at his disposal, he would not accept the offer,
but bought an animal for his own special use. Any
one who has ever been so unlucky as to borrow a
friend's favourite horse, will not find Beethoven's conduct
in this instance so very peculiar.</p>

<p>We can now imagine our master settled for a time,
in the possession of much that could make life enjoyable.
His days were entirely at his own disposal,
and generally occupied by study; his evenings were
passed either in his patron's <i>salon</i>, at Van Swieten's,
or at the house of some connoisseur. Wherever he
went, he was welcomed, in spite of his unpolished
manner and appearance.</p>

<p>We have seen how, rather than submit to the
necessity of an elaborate toilette, he would content<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
himself with the plainest fare; but there was that in
Beethoven's <i>physique</i> which the utmost pains could
never have smoothed down to the conventional
standard. Rather short, with a figure more indicative
of strength than elegance, hair that baffled
Figaro's efforts to reduce it to order, and a broad face,
whose one redeeming point was the lofty, expansive
forehead&mdash;a true throne of genius&mdash;Beethoven presented
a <i>tout-ensemble</i> which at once marked him out
from all others, and was an index to the independent,
original spirit within.</p>

<p>His demeanour was such as might be expected in
one who had made his own life-path, and had constantly
encountered hostility and misunderstanding;
brusque, angular, and a little defiant; but&mdash;where he
was sure of his ground&mdash;gentle and loveable as a
woman, innocent and guileless as a child.</p>

<p>Beethoven had no time for the <i>petits-soins</i> of life,
his thoughts were too deeply engrossed with higher
matters, but that he was the bear so often represented,
we emphatically deny. Such accusations
were brought against him by those who were incapable
of appreciating either him or his works, who
would have had the great poet descend to the
common level of every-day life, fritter away precious
time and thought, and force his powerful mind to the
punctilious observance of every little social etiquette.</p>

<p>One condition alone was necessary for Beethoven
to come out in a favourable light in society, viz, <i>he
must be understood</i>. Not flattered, not admired, not
caressed,&mdash;simply understood in his true character as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
poet, an artist, a revealer of beauty undreamt of by
others. The following anecdote is an illustration of
this:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When we were both still young (writes Herr von
Griesinger, Ambassador from the Court of Saxony
to Vienna), I only an <i>attach&eacute;</i>, and Beethoven only a
celebrated pianoforte player, but as yet little known
as a composer, we happened to be both together at
the house of Prince Lobkowitz. A gentleman, who
thought himself a great connoisseur, entered into a
conversation with Beethoven upon a poet's life and
inclinations. 'I wish,' said Beethoven, with his native
candour, 'that I was relieved from all the bargain and
sale of publication, and could meet with some one
who could pay me a certain income for life, for which
he should possess the right to publish exclusively all
that I wrote; and I would not be idle in composition.
I believe Goethe does this with Cotta, and, if I
mistake not, Handel's London publisher held similar
terms with him.'</p>

<p>"'My dear young man,' said this grave wiseacre,
'you must not complain, for you are neither a Goethe
nor a Handel, and it is not to be expected that you
ever will be, for such masters will not be born
again.'</p>

<p>"Beethoven bit his lips, gave a most contemptuous
glance at the speaker, and said not another word to
him. Afterwards, however, he expressed himself
pretty warmly on the subject of this flippant individual.</p>

<p>"Prince Lobkowitz endeavoured to draw Beet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>hoven
into more temperate habits of thought, and
said in a friendly manner, when the conversation once
turned upon this person, 'My dear Beethoven, the
gentleman did not intend to wound you; it is an
established maxim, which most men adhere to, that
the present generation cannot possibly produce such
mighty spirits as the dead, who have already earned
their fame.'</p>

<p>"'So much the worse, your Highness,' replied
Beethoven; 'but with men who will not believe and
trust in me because I am as yet unknown to universal
fame, I cannot hold intercourse.'</p>

<p>"Many then shook their heads, and called the
young composer arrogant and overbearing. Had
these gentry been able to look into the future, they
would have been a little ashamed of themselves."</p>

<p>With Beethoven's residence in the Lichnowski
Palace, many characteristic anecdotes are connected,
amongst others that already referred to of his reading
the complicated Bach MS. <i>a prima vista</i>.</p>

<p>But one of the most important features of his life
here was his connection with the Schuppanzigh Quartette,
afterwards known as the Razoumowski, which,
under his auspices, took so notable a place in musical
annals. The players were all very young (Schuppanzigh,
first violin, a boy of sixteen; Sina, second
violin, still a very young man; Weiss, viola, fifteen;
and Kraft, violoncello, only fourteen years of age),
and this was probably a recommendation in the eyes
of the Prince, who was passionately fond of the quartets
of Haydn and Mozart, and doubtless found that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
he could more easily inoculate young and unformed
minds with his peculiar views regarding the performance
of them, than he could persuade more
mature artists into adopting his views. Beethoven
was his able coadjutor in this attempt, and the boy-quartet,
directed by one not much older than themselves,
did honour to the discernment of their patron.
For many years they worked harmoniously together,
meeting for practice every Friday morning, and
probably no quartet-players, either before or since,
enjoyed advantages so great. For them Beethoven
composed his immortal productions, and his genius
fired and animated theirs, so that one mind and one
will alone seemed at work. The following note, preserved
by Schindler, relative to the production of the
difficult E flat major Quartet in March, 1825, shows
how his desire that his old companions should prove
equal to their reputation continued unabated to the
last:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">My good Friends</span>,&mdash;Herewith each will receive
his part, and must with it promise allegiance, and
pledge himself in all honour to do his very best to
distinguish himself, and to vie with the others in
zeal.</p>

<p>"Every one who wishes to take part in the affair
must sign this paper."</p>

<p class="center">(Here follow the four signatures.)</p></div>

<p>On one occasion a new pianoforte quartet by
F&ouml;rster, a well-known composer of the day, was in
progress of rehearsal. The violoncellist was suddenly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
called out, when Beethoven, who was at the pianoforte,
instantly began to sing the missing part in
addition to going on with his own, which he read for
the first time.</p>

<p>The Prince, astonished, asked him how he could
sing music with which he was not acquainted. Beethoven
smiled and replied, "The bass <i>must</i> have been
so, otherwise the author could have known nothing
whatever of composition." On the Prince remarking
further, that Beethoven had taken the <i>Presto</i> so
quickly that it was impossible for him to have seen
the notes, he answered, "That is not at all necessary.
A multitude of faults in the printing do not signify.
If you only know the language, you don't see them
or pay any heed to them."</p>

<p>To show the good understanding between Beethoven
and the Princess Christiane, we give the following
anecdote here, although it properly belongs to a
later period.</p>

<p>One evening, Ries, while still Beethoven's pupil, in
performing a sonata before a large company, played
a wrong note, on which the master tapped him on the
head with one finger by way of reminder. Beethoven
next took his seat at the pianoforte, and the Princess
(who always felt for the weak, and had observed that
Ries was rather vexed by the occurrence) stationed
herself behind the composer. Beethoven played the
beginning of one of his own compositions rather carelessly,
as he was often wont to do in commencing,
when the Princess seized her opportunity, and giving
him several well-directed blows, said: "When a pupil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
is punished with one finger for having failed in a
single note, the master deserves to be punished with
the whole hand for graver faults!" "Everybody
began to laugh," adds Ries, "and Beethoven the first.
He recommenced, and played admirably."</p>

<p>In the year 1793, the first of that unparalleled
series of works which ended only in 1827 with
Beethoven's death&mdash;the three Trios for pianoforte,
violin, and 'cello, Op. I.,&mdash;was publicly performed;
that is to say, before a large and brilliant assembly
in the Lichnowski Palace. The result was most gratifying,
alike to the composer and to his friends&mdash;Beethoven
was at once recognised as the successor
of Mozart. One incident alone detracted from the
happiness of the young author. Haydn, who was
present, while warmly praising the two first trios,
strongly recommended that the last, in C minor,
should not be published.</p>

<p>Beethoven's suspicion, already on the alert, was
fairly roused by this apparently well-meaning advice.
Why should that particular trio be kept back? He
himself thought it the best and most original of the
three, and as such it is now generally regarded.</p>

<p>It offered, however, such a contrast to his own
simple style of trio-writing, that Haydn was, perhaps,
honest in stating as his reason for advocating its non-publication
that he did not believe the public would
understand it. Beethoven, however, was strengthened
by this occurrence in his conviction that Haydn "did
not mean well by him;" and, though he deferred to
the criticism at the time (probably more out of re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>gard
to Lichnowski's representations) a bitter feeling
towards his former master rankled in his heart. This
did not prevent his dedicating the three Pianoforte
Sonatas, Op. II., to Haydn. The dedication, however,
was a mere mark of appreciation, not of the
man, but of his works, a compliment from one artist
to the other&mdash;not a grateful recognition of the master
by the pupil. In fact, when Haydn wished him to
inscribe on the title-page, "Pupil of Haydn," he
flatly refused, saying that he "had never learned
anything from him!"</p>

<p>We have said that he deferred to Haydn's criticism,
but he went beyond it. If the C minor trio was not
to be published, neither should the other two. So
the unlucky works were thrust back into his portfolio,
where they lay for two years, during which the
irate composer paved the way for their proper reception
by publishing an immense number of bagatelles,
especially variations on different themes, which have
no great value beyond that attached to them as
studies in the development of Beethoven's genius.</p>

<p>Although evincing more ingenuity and variety than
the themes treated by Mozart in the same way, they
are often found unequal to the latter in clearness.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
Beethoven seems to have had a lingering partiality for
this style of writing. After having abandoned it, we
find it adopted again in the Thirty-two Variations
S&eacute;rieuses on an original theme, which were written
after he had more than established his success in the
Sonata form; and, so anxious was he to have them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
well understood and rendered, that he made Ries,
when studying them with him, repeat the last no
fewer than seventeen times before he was satisfied
with the effect; "though," adds Ries rather na&iuml;vely,
"I thought I played it as well as Beethoven himself!"</p>

<p>The growth of the Thirty-three Variations, Op. 120,
we must leave to Schindler to relate:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In the villa of Hetzendorf, Beethoven wrote the
Thirty-three Variations on a Waltz by Diabelli, a
work which delighted him uncommonly. At first
there were only to be six or seven variations, for
which modest number Diabelli had offered him eighty
ducats (the price he received for almost each of his
later Sonatas). But when he set to work, there sprang
into life first ten, then twenty, then twenty-five&mdash;and
still he could not stop. When Diabelli heard of the
twenty-five variations, he was greatly concerned
lest the work should be too large, but was at last
obliged to accept for his eighty ducats, not <i>seven</i>, but
<i>three and thirty variations</i>." The following story is a
proof of the ease with which he invented variations.
Being one evening in a box with a lady during a performance
of "La Molinare," she lamented to him that
she had once possessed a number of variations on the
air "Nel cor non pi&ugrave; mi sento," which she had lost.
Next morning she received "Sei variazioni perdute
per la&mdash;ritrovate per Luigi v. Beethoven."</p>

<p>The year 1795 brought with it two events: one the
arrival of his brothers in Vienna; the other his first
appearance in public as a virtuoso. Hitherto his performances
had been confined to the Lichnowski<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
Palace, and other private houses, and public curiosity
had long been whetted by the various rumours which
flew about concerning him. At length it was to be
gratified, on the occasion of the Annual Concert for
the Widows and Orphans of Musicians. The direction
of this was usually entrusted to Salieri, who held
the <i>b&acirc;ton</i> at the Italian Opera-house, and his programme
for the year 1795 consisted of an operetta,
composed by one of his pupils, and a Pianoforte
Concerto in C major by another, Herr Louis van
Beethoven.</p>

<p>Wegeler relates that two days before the date
fixed for the event the Concerto was not yet finished,
and there did not seem much probability of its
being ready in time, as Beethoven was suffering
much from attacks of colic, to which he was often
subject. Wegeler, from his medical knowledge, was
able to render a little assistance, and so the work progressed,
Beethoven writing as fast as he could, and
handing over each sheet as it was finished to four
copyists who were in attendance in the antechamber.
Next day, at the rehearsal, the pianoforte was found
to have been tuned half a tone lower than the other
instruments; when Beethoven, to save time, played
the whole Concerto through in the key of C sharp!</p>

<p>Seyfried tells us that when Beethoven asked him
to turn over the leaves of several of his concertos for
him while playing in public, he found nothing but
a sheet of paper with here and there a bar filled in,
or a mass of notes unintelligible to any one but the
composer. Jahn describes Mozart as doing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
same, but what a difference is there between his concertos
and&mdash;say, <i>the Emperor</i>!</p>

<p>The year 1796 was marked by a slight variation;
Beethoven made a short journey to Prague and
Berlin, the only occasion, with the exception of his
visit to the Baths, on which he ever left Vienna or
its neighbourhood. In both cities he met with a
flattering reception. In Berlin he played his two
sonatas for pianoforte and 'cello, Op. 5, before
Frederick William II., who presented him with a
snuff-box filled with Friedrichs-d'or; "not an ordinary
snuff-box," as Beethoven was wont to remark
with grim satisfaction, "but one similar to those
given to ambassadors!"</p>

<p>Here, also, he unwittingly incurred the enmity of
the pianist Himmel. The latter had begged Beethoven
for an improvisation, with which request our
musician complied, and then asked Himmel to favour
him in return. Nothing loath, Himmel seated himself
at the pianoforte and began a succession of
smooth running passages and arpeggios, skilfully
linked together. Beethoven listened for a while in
silence, imagining this to be the prelude, but as it
seemed to "go on for ever," he said with some
impatience, "Pray do begin now!" Himmel, however
had already exhausted his imagination and
finished his (<i>quasi</i>) improvisation.</p>

<p>No better fate awaited others who opposed themselves
to Beethoven as improvisatori, not excepting
the celebrated pianists Woelfl and Steibelt. That
the former could ever have been seriously regarded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
as the rival of Beethoven is scarcely credible to us.
Such was the case, however, and as with Gluck and
Picini in Paris, and Handel and Buononcini in
London (connected with which Swift's well-known
<i>jeu-d'esprit</i> will occur to every amateur), so it was with
Beethoven and Woelfl in Vienna. Each had his
allies, and party spirit ran so high that Beethoven,
although devoid of any feeling of rivalry, accepted
a challenge to improvise. The meeting took place
at the villa of Baron von Wetzlar, Woelfl's patron;
the pianofortes were placed side by side, and the two
artists played and improvised by turns.</p>

<p>Inspired by the ardour of contest, each seemed to
surpass himself; never had Woelfl's technical skill
seemed greater; never had the wealth of Beethoven's
ideas shone out more resplendently. Some of
Woelfl's stoutest adherents contended that he had
gained the day in a technical point of view, and this
may, perhaps, have been the case, since his immense
hand, which enabled him to grasp tenths with the
same ease as octaves, undoubtedly gave him an
advantage. His sonata, "Non plus ultra," gives us
an idea of his execution.</p>

<p>Beethoven, on the other hand, never cared to make
a display of mere dash and brilliancy; technicalities
were always subordinated by him to idea and feeling.</p>

<p>The gift of improvisation must have been his to
an extent unparalleled either before or since. His
wealth of idea, certainty of form, and poetry of expression,
combined to produce an effect very different
from that achieved by ordinary extempore players,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
who in general, as we have seen in the case of
Himmel, mistook the art of preluding for that of
improvising. Only one conversant with that language
of music to which Beethoven often alluded,
could venture, without preparation, to speak to any
purpose in it.</p>

<p>A circumstance that contributed to his success
was his <i>power of abstraction</i>, which, in common with
all deep thinkers, he possessed in a remarkable degree.
With the first few bars of the given Thema,
the scene before his eyes, the daylight, the bystanders,
all vanished; and Beethoven was as fully
immersed in the solitude of his own thoughts as
though he had been suddenly transported to some
desert island, with penguins and sea-gulls for listeners.</p>

<p>Ries gives a curious instance of this utter disregard
of all outward things, in the story of the great
master's commencing one day, while giving him a
lesson, to play with the left hand the first fugue from
Graun's "Tod Jesu." Gradually the right hand was
added, and regardless of his awkward position, the
fugue developed in all conceivable manners for the
space of half an hour, when he suddenly awoke to
discover that his pupil was still in his place before
the pianoforte.</p>

<p>In 1800 a more formidable rival appeared at
Vienna in the person of Steibelt. Having conceived
a great idea of his own powers from the flattery
of his Parisian admirers, Steibelt came to the capital
sure of conquest, and did not even consider it neces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>sary
to visit the opponent so far beneath him. They
met accidentally at the house of Count Fries,
"where," says Ferdinand Ries, "Beethoven played
for the first time<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> his Trio in B flat major for piano;
clarionet, and 'cello, Op. 11, in which there is not
much room for display. Steibelt heard it with a
kind of condescension, paid Beethoven several compliments,
and believed himself sure of victory. He
played a quintet of his own composition, and then
improvised, and produced a great sensation by his
free use of <i>tremolo</i>, which was at that time something
quite new. To ask Beethoven to play again was
not to be thought of. Eight days after there was
again a concert at Count Fries'. Steibelt played
another quintet with great success; he had besides,
as might be easily perceived, <i>studied</i> a brilliant improvisation,
and chosen for a subject the theme on
which the finale of Beethoven's trio was built. This
disgusted the admirers of Beethoven, and displeased
the latter also. It was his turn to seat himself at the
pianoforte and to improvises. He placed himself at
the instrument with his ordinary air&mdash;I might say,
rather ill-humouredly, and as if pushed there. In
passing, he seized the violoncello part of Steibelt's
quintet, placed it upside down on the desk (was this
designedly?), and drummed out with one finger the
theme of the first few bars.</p>

<p>"Then, impelled by his insulted and excited feelings,
he improvised in such a manner that Steibelt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
quitted the room before Beethoven had ceased. He
would never meet him again, and, when invited anywhere,
always stipulated that Beethoven should not
be present."</p>

<p>But enough of such anecdotes! Triumphs which
would have been glory to others were nothing to
him. Let us pass on and see the master in the great
struggle which prefaced the real commencement of
life's work, and was continued without intermission
until the victory was won.</p>

</p>

<p>We left our young musician in the full flush of
success, in apparently vigorous health, caressed and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
flattered by princes, without a rival as a virtuoso, and
fast leaving all competitors behind him as a composer,
when suddenly a cloud appears, the brightness
is overcast, and darkness comes on apace.
<i>Beethoven became deaf.</i></p>

<p>For three years he had had premonitory fears,
which were too sadly realized in the year 1801.</p>

<p>The loss of hearing is deprivation enough in ordinary
cases; but to a young man of excitable artist
temperament, and a musician! it seemed for a while
worse than the loss of life itself. Our Beethoven writes
thus to Wegeler:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If I had not read somewhere that man must not
of his own free will depart this life, I should long
ere this have been no more, and that through my
own act."</p>

<p>From this despair he was mercifully rescued.
The strong, secret voice within, impelling Beethoven
onwards and upwards to that aim which he "felt, but
could not describe," spoke now in more stirring
accents and with more thrilling emphasis amid the
profound silence and desolation of his nature.</p>

<p>He "was not disobedient" to the heavenly call;
the triumph of mind was achieved; and from the
dark prison-house the noblest strains the world has
ever heard escaped to wake responsive echoes in the
hearts of all who have felt and suffered.</p>

<p>But this victory was not gained without leaving
behind it evident tokens of the struggle; distrust,
suspicion, irritability, those constant attendants on
deafness, haunted Beethoven day and night, poison<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>ing
his happiness, and casting their shadow over his
childlike, benevolent disposition. Stephan Breuning
writes thus of the alteration in his friend in a letter
dated the 13th of November, 1806:&mdash;"You cannot
realize the indescribable impression made upon Beethoven
by the loss of his hearing. Imagine, with his
excitable temperament, the feeling of unhappiness,
added to reserve, distrust of his best friends, and
indecision in many things. In general, intercourse
with him is a positive exertion, in which it is impossible
to feel entirely at one's ease; the occasions on
which his old true nature shows itself are few
indeed."</p>

<p>Schindler, also his friend and biographer, describes
him as being "like a child, devoid of all experience,
suddenly cast upon this earth from some ideal world;
like a ball, tossed from one hand to another; consequently,
at the mercy of other people. And," he
adds, "<i>so Beethoven remained throughout his whole
life</i>."</p>

<p>These evils were increased by the presence of his
brothers, Carl and Johann (the "evil principles" of his
life, as Schindler calls them), who now began to
exercise an almost unlimited influence over him.
These men seem to have been totally incapable of
appreciating the true character or work of Ludwig;
they only saw that he was making money rapidly
(and, as they thought, easily), and determined to
take advantage of it. To this end they resolved to
obtain entire possession of him, and began by endeavouring
to alienate as far as possible Beethoven's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
friends, misrepresenting to him all that occurred,
and fanning every little spark of anger into a
flame.</p>

<p>Their efforts partially succeeded; our unhappy
composer, absorbed in his own creations, overwhelmed
by his misfortune, and intensely irritable,
was but too ready to believe all the world in league
against him, and would have shut the door against
his best friends. Prince Lichnowski alone had still
some weight with him, and when once persuaded that
he had acted unjustly, nothing could exceed Beethoven's
contrition and desire to make amends to
those he had wounded.</p>

<p>But he would never lay any blame upon his brothers,
and even when their duplicity and falseness had been
clearly pointed out to him, he would still continue
to defend them strenuously, refusing to look upon
their conduct in any but the most favourable light,
and adding, "After all, they are my brothers."</p>

<p>It may easily be believed how, with dispositions
such as those of Carl and Johann, this mistaken
lenity and brotherly feeling confirmed them in their
course. It was they who generally made all arrangements
with the music publishers, and through their
instrumentality many minor pieces were given to
the world which the composer had produced in
Bonn, and kept back from publication as unworthy
of his name.</p>

<p>Such a consideration, however, had no weight with
the two; money they wanted, and were resolved to
get at all hazards. Once only did Beethoven come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
into collision with them regarding this, when he discovered
that Carl had, without his knowledge, sold
a copyright which had been promised to another
person.</p>

<p>Carl held a situation in the National Bank of
Austria, and Johann had been established by Beethoven
as an apothecary. In a very short time, however,
the latter became so wealthy (how?) as to be
able to exchange the pestle and mortar for the state
of a country gentleman. Of this he was so immoderately
proud, that one New Year's day he sent in
to his brother a card, on which was written,&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"Johann van Beethoven, Land Proprietor."</p>

<p>The composer, who was at table when it was brought
to him, laughed heartily, and writing on the other
side,&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"Ludwig van Beethoven, Brain Proprietor,"</p>

<p>sent it back to him.</p>

<p>The following letters to Wegeler display, more
fully than we can describe, Beethoven's condition
during the first few years of his calamity:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span style="margin-left:30em;">"<i>Vienna, 29th June</i>, (1801.)</span>
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear good Wegeler</span>,&mdash;How much I thank
you for your remembrance of me! I have deserved
it, and sought to deserve it, so little; and yet you
are so good, and will not allow yourself to be discouraged
even by my unpardonable neglect&mdash;you
are always the same true, good, worthy friend. That
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>I could ever forget you or yours, who were once so
dear and precious to me, do not believe; there are
moments in which I long for you, and wish that it
were in my power to spend some time with you.
My fatherland, the lovely spot in which I first saw
the light, is as distinct and beautiful before my eyes
now as when I first left you. In short, I shall consider
it one of the happiest events of my life when I
am able to see you, and to greet our Father Rhine
again. When this will be I cannot positively say.
So much I will tell you&mdash;you shall not see me again
until I have become really great&mdash;not as an artist
only, but a better and more perfect man: and if the
prosperity of my country be once more re-established,
my art shall be devoted solely to the relief of the poor.
Oh blissful moment! how happy do I consider myself
in being able to procure thee&mdash;to create thee!</p>

<p>"You want to know something about my position?
Well, after all it is not so bad. Lichnowski is still,
and always has been, my warmest friend, however incredible
it may appear to you. (Of course there were
little misunderstandings between us; but did they
not serve rather to cement our friendship?) Since
last year he has settled on me a pension of six
hundred guldens, which I am to draw until I find an
appointment suited to me. I make a great deal by
my compositions; indeed, I may say that there are
more demands upon me than I can execute. For
every one of my works I have at least six or seven
publishers, and could have more if I wished. They
do not drive bargains with me now: I demand, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>they pay. You see this is a very good thing. If, for
instance, I see a friend in difficulty, and am not in
funds to help him immediately, I have only to sit
down and write, and in a short time he is relieved.
I am also more economical than I used to be. If I
remain here permanently, I shall certainly contrive
to reserve one day in every year for a grand concert,
of which I have already given several. That malicious
demon, bad health, has cast a stumblingblock
in my path&mdash;for the last three years my hearing has
gradually become weaker. The original cause of this
defect is the state of my digestive organs, which, as
you know, was formerly bad enough, but has now
become much worse, for I have been constantly
troubled with diarrh&oelig;a, which has induced extreme
weakness. Frank tried to restore the tone to my
constitution by strengthening medicines, and to my
hearing by oil of almonds, but <i>prosit!</i> with no good
effect; my hearing grew worse, and my digestion remained
in the same state. This lasted till the autumn
of last year, and I was often in despair. Then one
medical <i>asinus</i> recommended cold bathing for my
complaint; another, a little more sensible, the ordinary
tepid Danube bath. This worked wonders;
my digestion became better, but my deafness continued
as bad as ever, or grew worse. Last winter
I was truly miserable, suffering so dreadfully from
colic that I fell completely back again into my
former state, in which I continued till about four
weeks ago, when I went to consult Vering;<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> partly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>because I think my complaint requires surgical treatment,
and partly also because I have always had
confidence in him. He succeeded in almost entirely
arresting the violent diarrh&oelig;a. He ordered me the
tepid Danube bath, into which I pour every time a
phial of some strengthening mixture; but he gave me
no medicine at all, except four days ago some digestive
pills and a lotion for the ears. I must say I find
myself much stronger and better for this treatment,
but the buzzing and ringing in my ears continues day
and night.</p>

<p>"I may say that I pass my life wretchedly; for
nearly two years I have avoided all society, because
I cannot possibly say to people, '<i>I am deaf!</i>' If I
were in any other profession it would not so much
signify, but for a musician it is a really frightful condition.
Besides, what would my enemies say to it?&mdash;and
they are not few!</p>

<p>"To give you an idea of this extraordinary deafness,
I must tell you that in the theatre I am obliged
to lean forward quite close to the orchestra in order
to understand the actors. The high tones of the
instruments and voices I do not hear if I am a little
way off. In conversation it is surprising that there
are some people who do not observe it&mdash;they attribute
it to the absent fits which I often have. Many
a time I can with difficulty distinguish the tones, but
not the words, of any person who speaks in a low
voice; and yet, directly any one begins to shout, it is
unendurable to me. What is to be the result of all
this, the good God alone knows. Vering says that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>my condition will certainly improve, though I may
not be perfectly restored. I have often already&mdash;cursed
my existence. Plutarch has led me to resignation.
I am resolved, if possible, to defy my fate,
although there should be moments in my life
when I shall be the most unhappy of all God's
creatures.</p>

<p>"I beg of you not to mention my state to any one,
not even to Lorchen;<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> I only confide it as a secret to
you. I should like much if you would correspond
some day with Vering about it. Should my affliction
continue, I shall come next spring to you. You shall
hire a house for me in some lovely spot in the
country, and there I shall become a peasant for
six months. Perhaps that might bring about a
change. Resignation! what a miserable refuge! and
yet the only one left to me!</p>

<p>"You must forgive me for adding the burden of
these friendly cares to your troubles, already gloomy
enough. Steffen Breuning<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> is now here, and we are
almost every day together; it does me so much
good to call up the old feelings. He has become
really a capital fellow, who knows something, and
has his heart pretty much in the right place, like
us all.</p>

<p>"I have very pleasant rooms now close to the
Ramparts,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> which is doubly advantageous for my
health. I think I shall be able to manage so that
Breuning may come to me.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Your Antiochus<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> you shall have, together with
plenty of music from me,&mdash;that is, if you do not fear
its costing you too much. Honestly, your love of
art rejoices me greatly. Only let me know how to set
about it, and I shall send you all my works, which
now amount to a pretty number, and are daily added to.</p>

<p>"Instead of the portrait of my grandfather (which
I beg you to send me as soon as possible with the
mail), I send you that of his grandson, your ever
loving and affectionate Beethoven. It has been
brought out here by Artaria, who, as well as other
publishers, has often begged me for it. I shall write
next to Stoffeln<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>, and read him a lecture about
his peevish temper. I shall sound our old friendship
well in his ears, and get him to promise sacredly not
to annoy you again in your present sad position.</p>

<p>"Never have I forgotten one of you, my dear, good
friends, although I may not have written often to
you; but writing, as you know, was never my <i>fort</i>;
even my best friends have not heard from me for
years. I live only in my music; and, no sooner is
one thing completed, than another is begun. In fact,
as at present, I am often engaged on three or four
compositions at one time.</p>

<p>"Write me now frequently; I shall make a point
of finding time to write you occasionally. Give my
kind regards to all, especially to the good Frau
Hofr&auml;thin<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>, and tell her that even now I sometimes
have a 'raptus.'</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"With regard to K&mdash;&mdash;, I am not at all surprised
at the change. Fortune rolls on like a ball; and
naturally, therefore, does not always stop at what is
noblest and best. One word for Ries,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> to whom remember
me cordially. With regard to his son,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> I
shall write you more particularly, but I believe that
Paris offers a better field for his exertions than
Vienna, which is so overstocked that even people of
the greatest merit find it a hard matter to maintain
themselves. By autumn or winter I shall see what I
can do for him, for then everybody will have returned
to town.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span style="margin-left:30em;" ><i>Vienna, November, 16th, 1801.</i></span>
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Wegeler</span>,&mdash;For this fresh proof of
your solicitude about me, I must thank you the
more, that I deserve it so little. You want to know
how I am progressing, and what remedies I use;
however unwilling I am in general to refer to this
subject, I do so with the least reluctance to you.</p>

<p>"For several months past, Vering has ordered me
to apply blisters constantly to both arms, made of
a certain kind of bark, which you doubtless know.
This is a most disagreeable remedy, inasmuch as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>(without taking the pain into consideration) I am
deprived of the free use of my arms for a few days,
until the blisters have drawn sufficiently. It is true,
and I cannot deny it, that the buzzing and ringing
are somewhat less than formerly, especially in the
left ear, that in which my malady first commenced&mdash;but
my hearing is certainly not a whit better.
I dare not say positively that it has not rather grown
worse.</p>

<p>"My digestion is better, especially after using the
tepid baths, when I feel tolerably well for eight or
ten days. Tonics I very seldom take, but follow
your advice now with regard to the herb-plasters.
Plunge baths Vering will not hear of. On the whole,
I am not at all pleased with him; he has far too
little solicitude or indulgence for a malady such as
mine; if I did not go to him, and this I cannot do
without great difficulty, I should never see him.
What do you think of Schmidt?<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> I am unwilling
to make a change, but it seems to me that Vering
is too much of a practitioner to gain fresh ideas by
reading. With regard to this, Schmidt appears
a very different sort of man, and might also, perhaps,
not be quite so negligent of my case.</p>

<p>"I hear wonders of galvanism&mdash;what say you to
it? A medical man told me that he had known
a deaf and dumb child whose hearing was fully
restored by it (in Berlin), and also a man who, after
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>having been deaf for seven years, recovered his hearing.
They tell me that your friend Schmidt is
making experiments on the subject.</p>

<p>"I lead a somewhat more agreeable life now that
I mingle more with other people. You can hardly
realize what a miserable, desolate life mine has been
for the last two years. Like a ghost did my deafness
haunt me everywhere, till I fled society, and
must have appeared a misanthrope&mdash;yet this is so
little my character.</p>

<p>"This change has been brought about by a lovely
and fascinating girl,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> who loves me, and whom I
love. After the lapse of two years I have again
enjoyed some blissful moments, and now for the
first time I feel that marriage can bestow happiness;
but, alas! she is not in the same rank of life as
myself; and at present, certainly I could not marry:
I must first bestir myself actively. Were it not for
my deafness, I would long ago have travelled half
round the world, and I must do it yet. For me
there is no greater pleasure than to follow and promote
my art. Do not believe that I could be happy
with you. What would there be, indeed, to make
me happier? Even your solicitude would pain me;
every moment I should read sympathy on your faces,
and should find myself only the more wretched.</p>

<p>"Those lovely scenes of my Fatherland, what part
had I in them? Nothing but the hope of a better
future, which would have been mine, were it not for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>this affliction! Oh! once free from this, I would span
the world! My youth, I feel it, is only beginning;
have I not always been a sickly creature? For some
time past my bodily strength has been increasing
more than ever, and my mental power as well. Every
day I approach nearer the goal which I feel, but
cannot describe. Only in this can your Beethoven
live. No rest for me! I know of none other than
Sleep, and sorry enough I am to be obliged to give
up more time to it than formerly. Let me be only
half delivered from this malady, and then&mdash;a more
perfect, mature man&mdash;I shall come to you, and renew
the old feelings of friendship.</p>

<p>"You shall see me as happy as I am destined to be
here below,&mdash;not unhappy. No, that I could not
bear. I will grasp Fate by the throat, it shall not
utterly crush me. Oh! it is so glorious to live one's
life a thousand times! For a quiet life, I feel it, I am
no longer made.</p>

<p>"Pray do write me as soon as possible. Persuade
Steffen to decide upon seeking an appointment somewhere
from the Teutonic Order.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> His position here
is too fatiguing for his health, and besides, he leads
such an isolated life, that I do not see how he is ever
to get on. You know how things are here. I will
not positively say that society would lessen his de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>pression,
but we cannot persuade him to join in it at
all. A short time ago I had some music in my house,
but our friend Steffen stayed away. Advise him to
be more calm and composed. I have already tried
all my powers on him,&mdash;without this he can never
be either happy or in good health. Tell me in your
next letter if there is any objection to my sending you
my music, even though there should be a quantity of
it. What you don't require, you can sell, and thus
get back what you paid for carriage,&mdash;and my portrait
into the bargain.</p>

<p>"Say all that is kind and obliging to Lorchen, as
well as to her mamma and Christoph. Have you still
a little love for me? Be convinced of the love as well
as of the friendship of</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:30em;">"Your<br /></span>
<span style="margin-left:32em;" class="smcap">Beethoven</span>."
</p></div>

<p>The year 1800 found Beethoven already busy with
his "Mount of Olives," which, however, was not produced
till 1803. This, the master's first and last
attempt at oratorio writing, "is a striking instance of
the insufficiency of even the highest powers to accomplish
that to which the special call has not been given.
It was impossible for Beethoven to feel himself so
inspired by his task as the composer of a time when
the mind of the people was almost exclusively occupied
by religious convictions; the man of the revolutionary
period could not see or think out a Christ like
that of Bach and Handel before him. Even the pure
spring, out of which we Protestants of the eighteenth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
and nineteenth centuries draw our ideas of Christ&mdash;the
Bible&mdash;flowed not for him; his Christ must first
be poetically made for him. And how? The poet
had no other aim but that of making verses for a
composer; the latter no other motive than the ordinary
creative impulse prompting him to try his powers
in a different and important sphere. The result on
both sides could not, therefore, be other than <i>Phrases</i>,
although the better of the two proceeded from the
composer, and that composer was Beethoven. To
conceal or palliate this would be derogatory to the
reverence which we all owe to Beethoven,&mdash;he stands
too high to be in need of extenuation."</p>

<p>So far Marx; but in addition to the miserable
libretto (which imparted unreality, artificiality, to the
whole work, and especially gave to the part of the
Saviour a theatrical air which Beethoven afterwards
deplored) many peculiarities of the oratorio&mdash;with all
deference to the able critic just quoted&mdash;may be
traced to the period in which it was composed. The
very choice of subject reveals the convulsion that
was taking place in Beethoven's <i>volcanic</i> nature.
It is a question whether Beethoven would ever
have asserted his sovereignty in this branch of
composition; it may be, as Marx hints, that the
peculiar tone of thought and feeling necessary to
the successful treatment of sacred subjects was
wanting in him; but there can be no doubt that
had the master's attention been devoted to the subject
in happier days, when his tempest-tossed natures
had attained to some degree of peace and serenity,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
the result would have been very different. Let him
who would see Beethoven as a <i>devotional</i> writer, turn
to his Gellert songs, which breathe the very depths
of true religious feeling.</p>

<p>The greater part of the oratorio, and also of
"Fidelio," was composed at Hetzendorf, a pretty little
village near the imperial summer palace of Sch&ouml;nbrunn.
Here Beethoven passed several summers in
the greatest retirement&mdash;wandering all day long,
from early dawn to nightfall, amid the leafy glades
of the park. His favourite seat was between two
immense boughs of an old oak, which branched out
from the parent stem about two feet from the ground.
This memorable tree, endeared to Beethoven as the
birthplace of many a thought, was afterwards visited
by him, in Schindler's company, in 1823.</p>

<p>In 1802 a gleam of hope dawned upon the sufferer;
his deafness was for a time cured by the
skilful treatment of Dr. Schmidt (to whom, out of
gratitude, he dedicated his Septet arranged as a
Trio), by whose advice he went for the summer to
the village of Heiligenstadt, in the hope that the
calm, sweet influence of nature, to which he was
at all times most sensitive, might act beneficially
upon his troubled mind.</p>

<p>This spot&mdash;this <i>consecrated town</i>&mdash;must always be
an object of veneration to those who cherish the
name of Beethoven, for here it was that he wrote
his remarkable will, or promemoria, a document
which excites our warmest sympathy, revealing, as
it does, the depths of that great heart.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">To my Brothers, Carl and &mdash;&mdash; Beethoven.</span><a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>&mdash;O
ye who consider or represent me as
unfriendly, morose, and misanthropical, how unjust
are you to me! you know not the secret cause of
what appears thus to you.</p>

<p>"My heart and mind have been from childhood
given up to the tender feeling of benevolence, and
I have ever been disposed to accomplish something
great. But only consider that for six years I have
been afflicted by a wretched calamity, which was
aggravated by unskilful physicians&mdash;deceived from
year to year by the hope of amendment&mdash;now forced,
at length, to the contemplation of a <i>lingering disease</i>
(the cure of which will, perhaps, last for years, if
indeed it be not an impossibility).</p>

<p>"Born with a passionate, lively temperament,
keenly susceptible to the pleasures of society, I was
obliged at an early age to isolate myself, and to pass
my life in loneliness.</p>

<p>"When I at times endeavoured to surmount all
this, oh, how rudely was I thrust back again by the
experience&mdash;the doubly painful experience&mdash;of my
defective hearing! and yet it was impossible for me
to say to people, Speak louder, shout; for I am deaf!
Alas! how could I proclaim the weakness of a sense
which ought to have been with me in a higher degree<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
than with others&mdash;a sense which I once possessed in
the greatest perfection&mdash;and to an extent which few
of my profession enjoy, or ever have enjoyed! Oh,
this I cannot do! Forgive me, therefore, when you
see me turn away where I would gladly mingle with
you. My misfortune is doubly painful to me, inasmuch
as it causes me to be misunderstood. For
me there can be no relaxation in human society,
no refined conversations, no mutual outpourings of
thought. Like an exile must I live. Whenever I
come near strangers, I am seized with a feverish
anxiety from my dread of being exposed to the
risk of betraying my condition.</p>

<p>"Thus it has been with me during these last six
months which I have spent in the country. The
orders of my sensible physician, to spare my hearing
as much as possible, were quite in accordance with
my present disposition; although often, overcome by
my longing for society, I have been tempted into it.
But what humiliation, when any one by my side heard
from afar a flute, and I heard <i>nothing</i>, or when any one
heard <i>the shepherd singing</i>, and I again heard <i>nothing</i>!</p>

<p>"Such occurrences brought me nigh to despair; but
little was wanting, and I should myself have put an end
to my existence. <i>Art</i>&mdash;art alone&mdash;held me back!
Ah! it seemed impossible for me to quit the world
before I had done all that I felt myself destined to
accomplish. And so I prolonged this miserable life; a
life so truly wretched that a sudden change is sufficient
to throw me from the happiest condition into the
worst.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Patience!</i> it would seem that I must now choose
her for my guide! I have done so. I trust that my
resolve to persevere will remain firm, until it shall
please the inexorable Fates to cut the thread of life.
Perhaps I may get better; perhaps not. I am prepared.
Compelled to be a philosopher in my twenty-eighth
year!<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> This is not easy&mdash;for the artist harder
than for any one else. O God! Thou lookest down
upon my heart, Thou seest that love to man and
beneficent feelings have their abode in it!</p>

<p>"O ye who may one day read this, reflect that
you did me injustice, and let the unhappy be consoled
by finding one like himself, who, in defiance of
all natural obstacles, has done all that lay in his power
to be received into the ranks of worthy artists and
men.</p>

<p>"My brothers, Carl and&mdash;&mdash;, as soon as I am
dead, if Professor Schmidt be still alive, beg him in
my name to describe my disease, and then add these
pages to the history of my malady, that at least, so
far as possible, the world may be reconciled to me
after my death.</p>

<p>"I also hereby declare you both heirs of my little
fortune (if so it may be called). Divide it honestly,
bear with and help one another. What you did
against me I have, as you know, long since forgiven.
I thank you in particular, brother Carl, for the attachment
which you have shown me of late. My wish is,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>that your life may be happier, and more free from
care, than mine has been. Recommend <i>Virtue</i> to
your children; it is she alone, and not money, that
can confer happiness. I speak from experience; for
it was Virtue who raised me when in distress. I have
to thank her, in addition to my art, that I did not put
an end to my life through suicide. Farewell, and
love one another! I thank all my friends, especially
Prince Lichnowski and Professor Schmidt. I should
like the instruments of Prince L. to be preserved by
one of you; but let no dispute arise between you on
this account. As soon as you perceive that it will
be more to your advantage, you have only to sell
them. How shall I rejoice, if even in the grave I can
serve you!</p>

<p>"Thus has it happened:&mdash;with joy I hasten to
meet Death. Should he come before I have had
opportunity to develop all my artistic powers, he will
have come too soon, notwithstanding my hard fate,
and I shall wish that he had tarried a little longer;
but even then I shall be content, for he will set me
free from a state of endless suffering. Come when
thou wilt&mdash;I go courageously to meet thee!</p>

<p>"Farewell, and do not quite forget me even in
death. I have deserved this of you, since in my life
I often thought of you, and wished to make you
happy.</p>

</p>

<p>"Thus I bid farewell to thee, mournfully enough.
Even the dearest hope that I brought hither with me,
the hope of being to a certain degree restored, has
utterly forsaken me. As the leaves of autumn fall
and wither, so has my hope faded. Almost as I came
do I depart; even the lofty courage which inspired
me during the lovely days of summer has vanished.
Oh, Providence! vouchsafe to me one more day of
pure happiness! The responsive echo of pure joy
has been so long a stranger to my heart. When,
when, O God! shall I again feel it in the temple of
nature and man? Never? Ah! that would be too
hard!"</p>

<p class="center">(On the outside.)</p>

<p>"For my brothers Carl and&mdash;&mdash;, to be read and
fulfilled after my death."</p></div>

<p>Several writers have maintained that the consequences
of Beethoven's deafness are plainly discernible
in his compositions; that he lost all idea of
harmonic relations, that his later works are mere
incongruous, erratic fancies, devoid of form and melody,
and, in short, compared to his former productions,
what the second part of "Faust" is to the first.</p>

<p>Happily, such ideas&mdash;promulgated by theorists of
the old school like F&eacute;tis, and dilettanti of the Mozart-Italian
school like Oulibicheff&mdash;have now exploded,
and the service rendered to Art by Beethoven's latest
works&mdash;especially his pianoforte sonatas&mdash;is fully re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>cognised.
It is these which have brought the pianoforte
to its present eminence as the most intellectual
and ideal of all instruments, and which, by their depth
of thought and loftiness of aim, have raised an insuperable
barrier between the dilettante who trifles
with music for amusement, and the artist who devotes
his life to its cultivation as a God-appointed means of
developing the divine in man.</p>

<p>At the same time we come upon passages here
and there which Beethoven would, perhaps, have
written otherwise, had his ear, as well as his mind,
been sensitive to their effect.</p>

<p>It is not posterity that has been the loser by Beethoven's
deafness; we, at least, ought to appreciate
the "precious jewel" which his adversity carried
within it, and has handed down to us. His contemporaries,
however, had cause to lament, for in a few
years it put a stop to all improvising and playing in
public. We read, indeed, of a plan for an artistic
tour with his pupil Ries, when the latter was to make
all arrangements for concert-giving, and to play the
pianoforte Concertos and other works, while Beethoven
conducted and improvised&mdash;but the project
never came to maturity. It was, in fact, impossible.
Beethoven entirely lost the sensitiveness of touch
which had once distinguished his playing from that
of all contemporaries; and, in his efforts to extract
some nourishment for his hungering ear, used to
hammer the pianoforte so unmercifully as generally
to break several strings. Nor could it be obviated
by a special instrument constructed for himself, nor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
by a sound-conductor invented for him by the ingenious
Graff.</p>

<p>A curious feature of his deafness was the gradual
manner in which the auricular nerve decayed; he
first lost the power of catching the higher notes of
singers or instruments, as we have seen, while deep,
low sounds were long audible to him; this may
account for the prevalence of those deep-lying tones
in almost all his later works, especially the Second
Mass and the Ninth Symphony.</p>

<p>As a natural consequence of his affliction, he soon
became unable to conduct his own orchestral works.
This, however, was no great loss, for he had never
possessed either the self-possession or the experience
necessary to wield the <i>b&acirc;ton</i> satisfactorily. Knowing
thoroughly as he did what every instrument had to
say, he listened excitedly for each in detail&mdash;without
calmly attending to the effect of the whole; at each
<i>crescendo</i> he would rise as if about to fly, gesticulating
so rapidly and energetically that the members of the
orchestra (who had enough to do to follow such new
and peculiar music) were often more bewildered than
guided by his directions. At the same time be it
distinctly understood that, however low the performance
might fall beneath his "ideal," however vexatious
the mistakes of individual performers might be, he
never lost his temper so far as to act in the manner
related by Ries in his Notices, of which the following
is a specimen:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Beethoven was present at the first performance of
his Fantasia for pianoforte, orchestra, and chorus.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
The clarinettist, in a passage where the beautiful
subject of the finale has already entered, made by
mistake a repetition of eight bars. As very few
instruments are heard at this point, the error in the
execution was torturing to the ear. Beethoven rose
furiously, turned round, and insulted the musicians in
the grossest manner, and so loudly that it was heard
by the whole audience. Then, resuming his seat, he
exclaimed, "From the beginning!" The movement
was recommenced, and this time all went well, and
the success was brilliant. But when the concert was
over, the artists recollected only too well the honourable
titles by which Beethoven had publicly addressed
them; and, as if the matter had but that moment
occurred, became excessively angry, and vowed never
to play again when Beethoven was in the orchestra,
&amp;c., &amp;c."</p>

<p>That the clarinettist did make a mistake is true,
but that Beethoven behaved in the outrageous way
described was most positively denied by all who were
present on the occasion, including the conductor,
Franz Clement. Where Ries got the story from is
difficult to imagine, since he was himself in St. Petersburg
at the time. On the contrary, the members of
the orchestra were all on excellent terms with Beethoven,
who prized their approval far more than that
of the general public; and was wont, when particularly
pleased with a performance, to turn round, his face
beaming with delight, and exclaim, "Bravi, tutti!"
But woe betide those who dared to question the
effect of the new and somewhat startling combina<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>tions
which he introduced! Ries found this out to
his cost. At the unexpected entrance of the horn in
the Allegro of the Eroica, he&mdash;as usual, beside his
master in the orchestra&mdash;exclaimed, "How abominably
wrong!" for which outburst he was nearly rewarded
by a box on the ear.</p>

<p>Pianoforte playing, improvisation, and orchestral
conducting were given up one after the other&mdash;not
suddenly, for Beethoven was resolved to defy his
fate as long as possible,&mdash;but henceforth it is with
Beethoven the composer alone that we have to do.</p>

<p>The autumn of 1802 saw him so far restored as
to be able to commence his great work on Napoleon,
which, however, on account of many interruptions,
was not finished until the year 1804.</p>

<p>In 1802 he writes thus to his publisher, Hofmeister,
who had requested him to compose a sonata of a revolutionary
tendency:&mdash;"Are you riding to the devil
in a body, gentlemen, that you propose to me to write
<i>such a sonata</i>? At the time of the revolutionary fever
it might have done, but now, when everything is once
more in the beaten track, when Bonaparte has signed
the Concordat with the Pope&mdash;now such a sonata!
If it had been a <i>missa pro Sancta Maria a tre voci</i>, or a
<i>Vesper</i>, I would immediately have taken pen in hand
and written in ponderous notes a <i>Credo in unum</i>,&mdash;but,
good heavens! such a sonata in these fresh, dawning
Christian times! Ho! ho! I'll have nothing
to do with it!" and yet at this very time he must
have been busy with a work destined to the honour
of the great Disturber of the Peace of Europe.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
The idea for this emanated originally from General
Bernadotte, the French Ambassador at Vienna&mdash;a
great admirer of the composer,&mdash;and was in reality
warmly entered into by Beethoven, who, with his
red-hot Republicanism and love for Plato, was an
enthusiastic supporter of the First Consul, and
imagined nothing less than that it was Napoleon's
intention to remodel France according to the Platonic
method, and inaugurate a golden age of universal
happiness. With the news of the empire came
the destruction of this elysian prospect,&mdash;Beethoven
in a fury tore to pieces the title-page of his symphony
on which was written simply,&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left:20em;" class="smcap">"Bonaparte.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:25em;" class="smcap">"Luigi v. Beethoven</span>;"<br />
</p>

<p>and stamping it under foot, showered a volley of
imprecations on the head of the tyrant who had
played so false a game.</p>

<p>No persuasion could induce him at first to publish
the work, but after the lapse of some years this
masterpiece of ideal writing was given to the world
under the title of "Sinfonia Eroica per festegiare il
sovvenire d'un grand' uomo." Great man as Napoleon
had been in Beethoven's estimation, he
never could think of him otherwise than with detestation,
till the sudden collapse of the Napoleonic
idea in 1815, and the death of its promoter in 1821,
changed his wrath into a kind of grim commiseration,
which he showed by remarking that he had "seventeen
years before composed the music suited to this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
catastrophe!" meaning the Funeral March in the
Eroica.</p>

<p>This, the first great manifesto of the Sovereign of
the World of Sound, was a wonderful advance on the
first two symphonies, produced somewhere about the
years 1800-1802. In these he took up the art where
Haydn and Mozart had left it; but, "though he could
dally and tarry awhile with them, he would not
remain with them;" his greater earnestness impelled
him on to realms unknown to them, to conquest compared
with which theirs faded into comparative insignificance.</p>

<p>In 1805 Ferdinand Ries left Vienna, after having
enjoyed Beethoven's instruction for five years. He
was, in fact, the only one whom Beethoven recognised
as his pupil (with the exception of the Archduke
Rudolph), and to him he entrusted the playing
of his concertos, &amp;c., for the first time, when no
longer able to do so himself. The impressions which
Ries has left in his Notices, of Beethoven as an instructor,
are like his other statements, somewhat
contradictory. In one place he declares that during
the lessons the master was engaged in composition
or some similar work at one end of the room, while
he was playing at the other, and that he seldom sat
down by him for half an hour at a time. Again,
he says that Beethoven took extraordinary pains
with him&mdash;sometimes extending the lesson over two
hours, and making him repeat ten times&mdash;nay, oftener&mdash;any
passage with which he was not quite satisfied.
Probably the truth lies between these two ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>tremes.
Beethoven, who had no settled order in
his life, could not be expected to be systematic in
tuition; hence the impression of desultoriness left
upon the mind of the pupil. A characteristic anecdote
of this period is worth quoting.</p>

<p>"Beethoven," says Ries, "had given me the manuscript
of his third concerto, that I might appear in
public with it for the first time as his pupil; Beethoven
conducted and turned over the pages for me.
I had begged him to compose a cadenza for me, but
he directed me to write one myself. He was satisfied
with my composition, and altered little; but one
brilliant and very difficult passage, which seemed to
him too hazardous, I was to change. The easier one
did not please me, and I could not make up my
mind to play it in public. The critical moment
arrived&mdash;Beethoven had seated himself quietly&mdash;but
when I boldly attacked the difficult cadence, he gave
his chair a violent push. The cadenza, however,
succeeded, and Beethoven was so delighted that he
exclaimed, 'Bravo!' which electrified the audience."</p>

<p>In 1805 Beethoven produced his solitary opera,
"Leonora" (afterwards known as "Fidelio"), amid
a series of annoyances and vexations such as probably
no operatic writer, either before or since, has
ever had to contend against. What between troubles
arising out of the libretto, the overture, the singers,
the critics, and the theatrical cabals, our poor Beethoven
was well-nigh driven distracted.</p>

<p>The story on which the opera is founded (originally
taken from the French, and so well known as to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
require no repetition here) is almost too slight for
dramatic purposes, inasmuch as there is but one
really powerful situation&mdash;that of the grave scene&mdash;in
the entire piece, and the whole interest, therefore,
is concentrated on the one figure, Leonora. What
Beethoven has made out of these slender materials;
how he has depicted, in all its intensity and tenderness,
that love which he was doomed never to experience,
needs no description from us.</p>

<p>What was Beethoven's object in choosing this
theme for his labours? Was it a foreshadowing of
bliss that might be his? or was it the delineation of a
character which, in its earnestness and purity, should
be the reverse of that "Don Juan" of Mozart, of
which he once said, "The divine art ought never to
be lowered to the folly of such a scandalous
subject"?</p>

<p>The little byplay and domestic "asides" cost our
soaring Beethoven infinitely more trouble than the
most impassioned scenas, and he was obliged to
write the little air of Marcelline, "O, w&auml;r' ich schon
mit Dir vereint," no less than thrice before he could
attain the requisite lightness.</p>

<p>The composition of the four "Leonora" overtures
is without a parallel in musical annals. When Beethoven
had finished No. 1, in C major, he consented
to its being first tried over by a small orchestra
at Prince Lichnowski's, in the presence of a select
number of critics and connoisseurs, by whom it was
condemned as being light and almost flimsy in structure,
and as affording no clue to the contents of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
opera. It was therefore withdrawn, and not published
till after the composer's death.</p>

<p>But may not the light-heartedness which distinguishes
this overture have been intentional on the
part of Beethoven? may he not have wished to represent
his heroine before the shadow of grief had
fallen upon her, in the enjoyment of the highest
wedded bliss?</p>

<p>Marx takes this view of "Leonora" No. 1, adducing
in support of it the following extract from
one of the manuscript books in which Beethoven was
accustomed to hold intercourse with his friends:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Aristotle, when he speaks of tragedy, says that
the hero ought first to be represented as living in the
greatest happiness and splendour. Thus we see him
in 'Egmont.' When he is in the enjoyment of felicity,
Fate comes and throws a noose over his head from
which he is not able to extricate himself. Courage
and Defiance appear upon the scene, and boldly look
Destiny&mdash;aye, and death&mdash;in the face. Cl&auml;rchen's
fate interests us, like that of Gretchen in 'Faust,'
because she was once so happy. A tragedy which
begins as well as continues gloomily, is tedious."</p>

<p>"Leonora" No. 2 was condemned on account of the
predominance of the wind instruments, and No. 3
ultimately, because the stringed instruments had so
much to do that precision was out of the question.</p>

<p>When, at length, the composer was satisfied with
his creation; when the singers (pacified by the
friendly intervention of Seyfried) had agreed to give
the music as it was written; when all difficulties<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
were apparently overcome, the unlucky composer's
annoyances reached a climax in the reception accorded
to his work by the public.</p>

<p>With great want of judgment (purposely to annoy
him, as Beethoven thought) the opera was produced a
few days after the French troops had entered Vienna;
when all his friends and patrons, including Lichnowski,
had sought refuge at their country seats till the
storm had blown over; and the theatre was filled with
French officers and soldiers, an audience utterly incapable
of appreciating the master. As might have
been anticipated, the work was coldly received, and,
after three representations, withdrawn. In 1806 it
met with the same fate, and not till 1814 did this, the
grandest work of the German school&mdash;a work which
has fought its way to every stage in Europe, and has
been brought home to every heart by a Malibran, a
Schr&ouml;der-Devrient, or a Tietjens,&mdash;obtain a favourable
hearing.</p>

<p>During the time the opera was in progress, Beethoven
(like Mozart in producing his "Seraglio")
suffered keenly from the jealousy of some of his
opponents, and his brothers took care that every barb
should find its way home to his sensitive mind. Even
his friend Stephan Breuning, in his great desire to
help the composer, aggravated the evil by the very
warmth of his partisanship,&mdash;and thus, by constant
dwelling upon them, many little slights assumed a
disproportionate magnitude, and annoyed our poor
Beethoven intensely.</p>

<p>But enough of darkness and despondency; life now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
begins, by one of those sudden and apparently inexplicable
changes, to wear a rosier hue for the composer.
Reserving our inquiry into the cause of this,
we close this chapter with the beautiful letter to the
poet Matthison, whose "Adela&iuml;de" he had set to
music some time previously.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Most esteemed Friend</span>,&mdash;You will receive, together
with this, a composition of mine which has
already been printed for several years, but of which,
to my shame, you perhaps know nothing yet.</p>

<p>"I may, perhaps, be able to excuse myself, and to
explain why I dedicated anything to you, which came
so warmly from my heart, and yet did not make you
acquainted with it,&mdash;by the plea that, at first, I did
not know where you resided, and then my diffidence
led me to think that I had been somewhat hasty in
dedicating anything to you without knowing if it had
your approval. And, indeed, even now I send you
the 'Adela&iuml;de' with some timidity. You yourself
know what changes a few years produce in an artist
who is constantly progressing; the more one accomplishes
in art, the less is one satisfied with former
works.</p>

<p>"My most fervent wish will be realized if you are
not altogether dissatisfied with the music to your
heavenly 'Adela&iuml;de,' and if you are incited by it to
compose a similar poem soon, and (should my request
not seem too bold) to send it to me forthwith, when I
shall put forth all my strength to approach your lovely
poetry in merit.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>
<p>"Consider the dedication as a mark of my esteem
and gratitude for the exquisite pleasure which your
poetry has always afforded, and will still afford me.</p>

<p>"When playing the 'Adela&iuml;de,' remember sometimes</p>

<p>hence comes it that after a storm of darkness
and gloom&mdash;after the disappointment
of his "Leonora"&mdash;the next offspring of the
poet's fancy should be a symphony (No. 4), the most
delicately finished and bright in colouring which we
possess?</p>

<p>The mystery is not easily solved. Former biographers
have at once come to the conclusion that
this was the period in which Beethoven's love for
Julia Guicciardi, alluded to in a letter to Wegeler,
had reached its climax. This hypothesis has, how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>ever,
been put to flight by the discovery of Alexander
Thayer that the lady was married to Count
Gallenberg (afterwards the Keeper of the Archives
of the Imperial Opera) in 1803&mdash;that is, three years
before the composition of the work.</p>

<p>Is the B flat major Symphony, after all, as much
the exponent of the master passion as is, in another
way, the C sharp minor Sonata? Or is it, with its
troubled, gloomy opening, expanding into glorious
warmth and sunshine, another evidence of Beethoven's
resolution to set fate at defiance, and to
keep at bay the monster Grief which threatened to
annihilate him? Who can tell? When the traveller,
suddenly emerging from some mist-hung mountain
gorge, steps out upon the rocky platform, he beholds
in the distance, beneath his delighted gaze, a landscape
bathed in sunshine; so to the poet's excited
fancy there must have been present some bright
vision, one of those "loftier spirits, who sported with
him and allotted to him nobler tasks," drawing a
veil over the troubled Past, and pointing him onwards
to a glorious Future.</p>

<p>Let the Reader take which interpretation he will.</p>

<p>We propose briefly to present to him the two
sets of letters which show us Beethoven in two different
aspects as a lover&mdash;the first <i>pur et simple</i>, the
second Platonic.</p>

<p>Nothing is known with certainty of Beethoven's
"immortal beloved," whose name vibrates throughout
the Adagio of the Moonlight Sonata. The letters
to her (of date unknown, written from some baths in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
Hungary, whither he had been ordered for his health)

<p >"My Angel! my All! my Second Self!</p>

<p>"Only a few words to-day, written with a pencil (with
thine). My residence will not be definitely fixed before to-morrow.
What a ruinous waste of time!&mdash;Why this deep
sorrow where Necessity speaks? can our love exist otherwise
than by sacrifices, than by our not expecting everything?
Canst thou alter the fact that thou art not wholly mine,
that I am not wholly thine?&mdash;Alas! look into the beauties
of Nature, and calm thy mind for what must be endured.
Love demands all, and with perfect right, and thus <i>I feel
towards thee</i> and <i>thou towards me</i>, only thou forgettest so
easily that I have to live <i>for myself</i> and <i>for thee</i>,&mdash;were
we perfectly united, thou wouldst feel this trial as little as
I do.</p>

<p>"My journey was terrible. I only arrived yesterday at
four o'clock in the morning, owing to the want of horses.
The driver chose another route, but what a fearful one!
At the last station they warned me not to travel by night,
and tried to terrify me by a forest, but this only stimulated
me, though I was wrong. The carriage broke down on
that dreadful road, a mere rough, unmade country lane, and
had not my postillions been what they were, I should have
been obliged to remain there by the wayside.</p>

<p>"Esterhazy, on the usual route, had the same fate with
eight horses that I had with four, and yet I felt a certain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>degree of pleasure, as I always do when I overcome anything
happily.&mdash;Now, in haste, from the outer to the inner
man! We shall probably soon see each other again. I
cannot communicate to thee to-day the reflections I have
been making, during the last few days, on my life&mdash;were
our hearts ever near to one another, I should make none
such. My heart is full of much that I have to say to thee.
Ah! there are moments in which I feel that language is
absolutely nothing. Take courage! continue to be my true,
my only treasure, my All, as I am thine. The gods must
send the rest&mdash;that which is ordained to be, and shall be
for us.</p>

<p>"Even before I rise my thoughts throng to thee, my immortal
beloved, at times with joy, then again mournfully,
waiting to hear if fate be favourable to us. I can only live
entirely with thee, or not at all. Yes! I am resolved to
wander apart from thee until the moment shall arrive when
I may fly into thine arms, may feel my home in thee, and
send my soul encompassed by thine into the world of
spirits. Yes, alas! it must be so! Thou wilt be prepared,
for thou knowest my faithfulness. Never can another
possess my heart; never, never. Oh God! why must I fly
from what is so dear to me?&mdash;and yet my life in V&mdash;&mdash; is,
as at present, a sorrowful one. Thy love made me at once
the happiest and the most miserable of men. At my age I
require a uniformity, an evenness of life; and can this be
possible in our relations?&mdash;Angel! I have just heard that
the post goes out every day; and must stop that thou
mayest receive this letter soon.&mdash;Be calm; only by calmly
viewing our existence can we attain our aim of passing our
lives together. Be calm; love me&mdash;to-day&mdash;yesterday&mdash;what
longing, what tears for thee&mdash;for thee&mdash;for thee&mdash;my

<p>It was indeed the case that no other love ever did
"possess his heart" in the same way. This was, if not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
his first, at least his only <i>real</i> love. Such letters as
these Beethoven wrote to no one else; the contrast
between them and the three following (addressed
to Bettina Brentano, afterwards Madame von Arnim)
will be at once apparent:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dearest Friend</span>,&mdash;Never has there been a more
beautiful spring than this year; I say so, and feel it too,
because in it I first made your acquaintance. You have
yourself seen that in society I am like a fish on the sand,
which writhes, and writhes, and cannot get off until some
benevolent Galatea throws it back into the mighty ocean.
I was, indeed, quite out of my element, dearest friend, and
was surprised by you at a time when discouragement had
completely mastered me&mdash;but how quickly it vanished at
your glance! I knew at once that you must be from some
other sphere than this absurd world, in which, with the best
will, one cannot open one's ears. I am a miserable being,
and yet I complain of others!!&mdash;But you will forgive me
for this with that good heart which looks out of your eyes,
and that intelligence which is hidden in your ears,&mdash;at
least they know how to flatter by the way in which they
listen.</p>

<p>"My ears are, alas! a partition wall through which I
cannot easily have any friendly intercourse with men.
Otherwise!&mdash;perhaps!&mdash;I should have felt more assured
with you; but I could only understand the full, intelligent
glance of your eyes, which has so taken hold of me, that I
shall never forget it. Dear friend, dearest girl!&mdash;Art! who
understands her? with whom can I discuss this great goddess?...
How dear to me are the few days in which we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>chatted together, or, I should say, rather corresponded!
I have preserved all the little notes with your witty, charming,
most charming answers, and so I have to thank my
defective hearing that the best part of those hasty conversations
is written down. Since you left I have had vexatious
hours&mdash;hours of shadow in which I can do nothing. I wandered
in the Sch&ouml;nbrunn All&eacute;e for about three hours after
you left, but no angel met me who could have taken possession
of me as you did, <i>my Angel</i>.</p>

<p>"Pardon, dearest friend, this deviation from the original
key, but such intervals I must have as a relief to my heart.
So you have written about me to Goethe, have you not?
I could bury my head in a sack, so that I might not hear or
see anything of all that is going on in the world, because I
shall not meet you again, dearest angel, but I shall receive a
letter from you soon. Hope sustains me, as she does half
the world; through all my life she has been my companion.
What would otherwise have become of me?&mdash;I send you
'Kennst du das Land,' written with my own hand, as a
remembrance of the hour in which I first knew you. I send
you also another, which I have composed since I took leave
of you; my dearest <i>Herz</i>!"</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear, beloved Friend</span>,&mdash;I have already had two letters
from you, and see from those to Tonie that you still
remember me, and even too kindly. Your first letter
I carried about with me the whole summer, and it has often
made me very happy. Although I do not write to you
frequently, and you see nothing at all of me, yet in thought
I write you a thousand times a thousand letters. How you
must feel in Berlin amongst all the frivolous, worldly rabble,
I could imagine, even though you had not written it to me
yourself,&mdash;mere prating about Art without any results!! The
best description of this is to be found in Schiller's poem,
'The River,' in which the Spree speaks.&mdash;You are about to
be married, dear friend, or are so already, and I have not
been able to see you even once previously. May all the
felicity with which marriage blesses those who enter into
her bonds be poured upon you and your husband! What
shall I say to you about myself? I can only exclaim with
Johanna, 'Compassionate my fate!' If I am but spared
for a few years longer, I will thank Him who embraces all
within Himself&mdash;the Most High&mdash;for this as well as for all
other weal and woe.&mdash;If you should mention me when
writing to Goethe, strive to find all those words which can
express to him my deepest reverence and admiration. I am
just about to write to him myself regarding 'Egmont,' to
which I have composed the music, solely out of love for his
poetry, which always makes me happy;&mdash;but who can sufficiently
thank a Poet, the most precious jewel of a Nation!
Now no more, my dear, good friend. I only returned this
morning from a <i>Bacchanale</i> where I laughed too heartily,
only to weep nearly as much to-day; boisterous joy often
drives me violently back upon myself. As to Clemens,
many thanks for his courtesy; with regard to the Cantata,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>the subject is not important enough for us, it is very different
in Berlin. As for my affection, the sister has so large a
share of it that not much is left for the brother&mdash;will he be
content with this? Now farewell, dear, dear friend. I imprint
a sorrowful kiss upon your forehead, thus impressing,
as with a seal, all my thoughts upon it. Write soon, soon,
often, to your Brother,</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My most dear, kind Friend</span>,&mdash;Kings and princes
may indeed be able to create professors and privy councillors,
and to bestow titles and decorations, but great men they
cannot make. Spirits that tower above the common herd,
these they cannot pretend to make, and therefore they are
forced to respect them. When two men like Goethe and
myself come together, these grandees must perceive what is
accounted great by such as we.</p>

<p>"On our way home yesterday we met the whole imperial
family; we saw them coming in the distance, when Goethe
immediately dropped my arm to place himself on one side;
and say what I would, I could not get him to advance
another step. I pressed my hat down upon my head,
buttoned up my great-coat, and made my way with folded
arms through the thickest of the throng. Princes and
courtiers formed a line, Duke Rudolph took off his hat,
the Empress made the first salutation. The great ones of
the earth <i>know me</i>! To my infinite amusement, I saw the
procession file past Goethe, who stood by the side, hat in
hand, bending low. I took him to task for it pretty smartly,
gave him no quarter, and reproached him with all his sins,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>especially those against you, dearest friend, for we had just
been speaking about you. Heavens! had I been granted
a time with you such as <i>he</i> had, I should have produced
many more great works! A musician is also a poet, and
can feel himself transported by a pair of eyes into a more
beautiful world, where nobler spirits sport with him, and
impose great tasks upon him. What ideas rushed into my
mind when I first saw you in the little observatory during
that glorious May shower, which proved so fertilizing to
me also! The loveliest themes stole from your glances
into my heart,&mdash;themes which shall enchant the world when
Beethoven can no longer direct. If God grant me a few
years more, I must see you again, my dearest friend; the
voice which ever upholds the right within me demands it.
Spirits can also love one another; I shall ever woo yours;
your applause is dearer to me than aught else in the world.
I told Goethe my opinion of the effect of applause upon
men like us&mdash;we must be heard with intelligence by our
peers; emotion is very well for women (pardon me), but
music ought to strike fire from the souls of men. Ah!
dearest child, how long is it since we were both so perfectly
agreed upon all points! There is no real good but the
possession of a pure, good soul, which we perceive in
everything, and before which we have no need to dissemble.
<i>We must be something if we would appear something.</i> The
world must recognise us, it is not always unjust; but this
is a light matter to me, for I have a loftier aim.</p>

<p>"In Vienna I hope for a letter from you; write soon,
soon and fully; in eight days I shall be there. The court
goes to-morrow; to-day they are to play once more. Goethe
has taught the Empress her <i>r&ocirc;le</i>. His duke and he wished
me to play some of my own music, but I refused them
both, for they are both in love with Chinese porcelain. A
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>little indulgence is necessary, for understanding seems to
have lost the upper hand; but I will not play for such
perverse tastes, neither do I choose to be a party to the
follies of princes who are for ever committing some such
absurdity. Adieu, adieu, dear love; your last letter lay for
a whole night next to my heart, and cheered me there.
Musicians allow themselves everything. Heavens! how
I love you!</p>

"Your most faithful friend and deaf brother,<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left:35em;" class="smcap">"Beethoven</span>."<br />
</p></div>

<p>These letters were first published in Bettina's
book, "Ilius Pamphilius und die Ambrosia," but the
style is so unlike Beethoven's simple mode of expression,
that it is difficult to discover what the composer
really wrote to Bettina, and what has been supplied
by the latter's rather too vivid imagination. The
reiterated <i>dear</i>, <i>dearest</i>, and the <i>write soon</i>, <i>soon</i>, <i>often</i>,
are very feminine and very <i>un-Beethovenish</i>. This
strange, inexplicable little being, who fascinated
not only Beethoven, but every one else with whom
she came in contact, has also published an account
of her interviews with Beethoven. This is so highly
coloured that we may be excused for doubting the
perfect truth of the recital, especially as we know
what a gloss&mdash;nay, what falseness&mdash;she contrived to
give to all that related to her intercourse with Goethe.
She herself tells us, na&iuml;vely enough, that when she
showed Beethoven one morning her account of what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
he had said the previous day, he was quite surprised,
and exclaimed, "Did I really say that? I must
have had a <i>raptus</i>!"</p>

<p>Bettina was, however, of some service to him, as it
was doubtless she who paved the way to his acquaintance
with Goethe, and their meeting in 1812
at Toeplitz; and her family remained true, warm
friends of the composer long after the great minister
had forgotten his very existence.</p>

<p>Beethoven was most unfortunate in his attachments,
the objects of which were always of much
higher social standing than himself. Constantly
associating with people of rank and culture, it was
natural that to the sensitive nature of our poet, the
young girl nobly born, with all the intuitive, nameless
fascinations of the high-bred aristocrat, should present
a great contrast to the plebeian, every-day graces
of the <i>bourgeoise</i>. Beethoven used to say that he had
found more real appreciation of his works amongst
the nobility than in any other circle, and we can
hardly wonder at the infatuation with which he stakes
all his chances of happiness on a love which he knows
can never be gratified.</p>

<p>The following little scrap in his handwriting has
been preserved:&mdash;"Only love&mdash;yes, only that&mdash;has
power to give me a happier life. Oh, God! let me
at length find her&mdash;her who destined to be mine, who
shall strengthen me in virtue!" Schindler imagines
that these words have reference to a well-known
dilettante of great talent, Fr&auml;ulein Marie Pachler,
whom Beethoven admired exceedingly. He never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
summoned up courage enough to propose to her
however, and she afterwards married an advocate in
Gratz. This lady may also be the subject of the
allusion in a letter to Ries, 1816:&mdash;"Say all that is
kind from me to your wife; I, alas! have none. I
found only one with whom I could have been happy,
and she will probably never be mine. But I am not
on this account a woman-hater!"</p>

<p>Another love of Beethoven's was the Countess
Marie Erd&ouml;dy, to whom he dedicated the two splendid
Trios, Op. 70, but this seems to have been
entirely a Platonic affection.</p>

<p>Who can exaggerate the immense benefit that a
loving, tender wife would have been to Beethoven&mdash;a
wife like Mozart's Constance? The consciousness
of one ever by his side to whom he might safely confide
all that wounded or annoyed him, would have
more than neutralized the chilling, exasperating
effects of the calamity that had overtaken him,
would have been a fresh impetus to great achievements.
But fate had willed it otherwise.</p>

<p>In nothing was the want of a wife so apparent
as in Beethoven's domestic <i>m&eacute;nage</i>, which certainly
was the <i>non plus ultra</i> of discomfort. One great
cause of this was his habit of frequently changing
his abode. He had long since left the Lichnowski
Palace, his infirmity rendering it desirable that he
should have a home of his own, but he was extremely
difficult to please in the choice of a residence. One
house he would leave because the sun did not shine
into his apartment; another because the supply of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
water was deficient (a serious drawback to him, as he
was accustomed to lave his head and face profusely
while composing), and for even less cogent reasons he
would pack up and leave at an hour's notice, so that
it soon became a difficult matter to find a suitable
abode for him. It may easily be imagined that this
constant removal was not effected without considerable
outlay, and so badly did he manage that at one
time he had no less than four houses on his hands.
When all other resources failed, he would take refuge
in the fourth story of his friend Baron Pasqualati's
house, which was constantly reserved for him. The
summer he always spent in the country, generally in
a hired lodging. On one occasion a suite of apartments
in the villa of Baron Pronay had been placed
at his disposal, and as the house stood in the midst
of a superb park, it was thought that Beethoven would
be fully satisfied. In a few days, however, the bird
had flown, alleging as his reason that he could not
endure to listen to the ceremonious salutation with
which his host accosted him every morning in his
ramble&mdash;much less to return it!</p>

<p>Oulibischeff's amusing description of our composer's
surroundings is worth repeating:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In his room reigned a confusion, an organized
chaos, such as can hardly be imagined. Books and
music lay on every article of furniture, or were heaped
up like pyramids in the four corners. A multitude
of letters which he had received during the week or
the month covered the floor like a white carpet with
red spots. On the window-sill were displayed the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
remains of a succulent breakfast, by the side or on
the top of proof sheets awaiting correction. There a
row of bottles, partly sealed, partly empty; further
on an <i>escritoire</i>, and on it the sketch of a quartet; on
the pianoforte a flying sheet of note-paper with the
embryo of a symphony; while to bring so many
directly opposite things into harmony, everything
was united by a thick layer of dust.</p>

<p>"It may easily be imagined that amidst such a
<i>well-arranged whole</i>, the artist had often no small
trouble to find what he required. He used to complain
bitterly about this, and always put the blame on
other people's shoulders, for he fancied that he was
extremely systematic in the way in which he kept
his things, and used to declare that in the darkest
night he could find even a pin belonging to him, if
people 'would but put things back in their proper
places'!</p>

<p>"On one occasion an important paper was missing&mdash;neither
a sketch nor a loose sheet, but a thick,
clearly copied score from the Mass in D. At last it
was found; but where, think you? In the kitchen,
where it had been used to wrap up eatables! More
than one <i>Donnerwetter</i>! and more than one bad egg
must have flown at the head of the devoted cook,
when this was discovered; for Beethoven liked
fresh eggs too well to use them as missiles....
Once, when he had dismissed his housekeeper, a very
good orderly person (and soon received into favour
again), he resolved to make himself independent,
and to keep no more servants, since they only 'worked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
mischief in the house.' And why should he not
wait upon himself, and look after the kitchen himself?
Could it be more difficult to prepare a dinner than to
compose a C minor symphony? Charmed with this
glorious idea, Beethoven hastens to put it into
execution. He invites some friends to dinner, buys
the necessary provisions in the market, and carries
them home himself; ties on the business-like white
apron; adjusts the indispensable nightcap on his head;
grasps the cook's knife, and sets to work. The guests
arrive, and find him before the fire, whose scorching
flame seems to act like the fire of inspiration upon
him. The patience of the Viennese appetites was put
to an unwonted trial. At length the dishes were
placed on the table, and the host proved that it was
worth while waiting for him. The soup might have
challenged the <i>soupe maigre</i> given in charity; the
boiled meat, scarcely cooked, presupposed in individuals
of the human race the digestion of an
ostrich; the vegetables swam in a sea of fat and
water; the roast meat, splendidly burned to a cinder,
looked as though it had found its way down the
chimney; in short, nothing was fit to eat. And
nobody did eat anything except the host, who by
word and example encouraged his guests to fall to.
In vain; Beethoven's <i>chefs-d'&oelig;uvre</i> of cookery were
not appreciated, and the guests made their dinner
on bread, fruit, and sweetmeats, adding plenty of
wine to prevent any bad effects from their enforced
abstinence. This remarkable feast convinced even
the great Maestro that composing and cooking are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
two very different things, and the unjustly deposed
cook was speedily re-established in her rights."</p>

<p>It was very fortunate for Beethoven that after some
years passed in this erratic way, a sensible lady-friend
at length came to the rescue, and by her
feminine tact and adroitness, succeeded in persuading
him to abandon his nomadic habits to some
extent, and to mingle a little more in society. This
was Frau Nanette Streicher, the amiable wife of the
celebrated instrument maker, and early friend of
Schiller. She began by putting the wardrobe of the
composer to rights (as might be imagined, it was
in a deplorable plight), and afterwards, in conjunction
with her husband, hired a respectable house for
Beethoven, furnished it suitably, and engaged a man
(a tailor by trade) and his wife to wait upon him.
In this quiet haven our tempest-tossed Beethoven
came to anchor for a while, and might have been
seen busy over his pianoforte, or among his papers,
while his cross-legged knight of the Goose stitched
away comfortably in the adjoining anteroom.</p>

<p>When fairly domiciled, Beethoven's mode of life
was very regular. His habit was to rise every
morning, winter and summer, at daybreak, when he
at once proceeded to his desk, where he wrote till
about two o'clock without any interruption, except
the necessary interval for breakfast, and&mdash;if his
ideas did not flow rapidly enough&mdash;an occasional
run of half an hour or longer into the open air.
Between two and three he dined, after which it was
his invariable custom to make the circuit of the town<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
twice or three times; and no weather could keep him
within doors&mdash;summer heat or winter frost, thunder,
hail, rain, sleet,&mdash;nothing prevented this afternoon
ramble. It was, in fact, his time for composition;
he never ventured out without his note-book to
preserve any fugitive thoughts that might flit across
his mind, and used laughingly to apply to himself
Johanna's words, "I dare not come without my
banner!" Necessarily, therefore, he was a very
silent companion, but in <i>one</i> sense only, as the whole
way he continued humming (or rather growling) in
a manner peculiar to himself any thema on which
he was mentally at work. Ries relates that on one
occasion when they were walking together, Beethoven
suddenly exclaimed, "A theme has occurred
to me!" They hurried onwards in silence, and on
arriving at home the master went at once to the
pianoforte (without even removing his hat), where
he thundered like an inspired giant for more than
an hour, during which the beautiful finale to the
Sonata Op. 54 (in F major) struggled into existence.</p>

<p>Beethoven generally returned from his promenade
only when warned by the shadows that evening was
coming on; then alone in the darkening twilight
he loved to breathe to his best, his only friend, his
<i>Clavier</i>,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> the thoughts which met with no response
in human sympathy. During the evening he very
seldom worked, but would smoke his pipe, and play
occasionally on his viola or violin, both of which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>must always be placed ready for him on the pianoforte.</p>

<p>Our poor deaf Beethoven had, too, his little coterie
of sincere and attached friends, among whom his
real nature could show itself without restraint or
distrust, and who clung to him through life in spite
of the unceasing efforts of the two brothers to dislodge
them. These were&mdash;naturally Prince Lichnowski
and his brother Count Moritz, who cherished
a love and admiration for Beethoven which the latter
warmly reciprocated, dedicating to the Count his
Variations, Op. 35, and the beautiful Idyl, Op. 90.
To these must be added the worthy Baron von
Zmeskall, a Hungarian State Secretary, to whom the
composer addressed many a humorous epistle; his
old friend Stephan Breuning; the Baron von Gleichenstein;
his secretary Schindler; and last, but not
least, Franz, Count von Brunswick, to whom he dedicated
the Sonata Appassionata, and who had more
influence over him than anybody else.</p>

<p>One proceeding Beethoven never omitted, viz.,
the reading of the evening paper. In these stirring
times the newspaper was an absolute necessity, and
our musician would never retire to rest without previously
ascertaining the state of the political horizon.
He used to frequent a coffee-house which boasted
another means of exit besides the general one, and
taking up his position in the background, he would
steadily peruse the <i>Gazette</i> (not a very long task in
those days, when "our own" correspondents were as
yet undreamt of), and as soon as the last word of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
the last page had been scanned, beat a hasty retreat
through the private door, and wend his solitary way
homewards. Ten o'clock rarely found him out of
bed. Such was his simple, innocent day! It was
no mere phrase, that declaration of his, "<i>I live only
in my art</i>,"&mdash;it was indeed the one connecting link
between him and others.</p>

<p>What he produced in suffering and loneliness
stirred, like a mighty wind among the forest branches,
the noblest feelings of a thousand hearts, bidding
them grapple with Destiny as he had done, and prove
themselves <i>men</i> and heroes!</p>

</div>
<p>he period between the years 1805 and 1814
may be considered that of Beethoven's greatest
creative energy. It is almost impossible to
keep pace with the stream of colossal works which
flowed without intermission from his pen. To this
period belong the G major and E flat pianoforte
concertos, without exception the most poetical and
the noblest compositions of the kind which we
possess; the fantasia for pianoforte, orchestra, and
chorus; the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth
symphonies; the "Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage"
on Goethe's short but suggestive poem, "<i>Tiefe Stille
herrscht im Wasser</i>; <i>ohne Regung ruht das Meer</i>;"
the First Mass; the music to "Egmont;" the over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>tures
to Collin's tragedy of "Coriolanus," and to
"King Stephen," and the "Ruins of Athens,"&mdash;each of
which, from its intellectual grasp of subject, wonderful
ideality, and highly finished detail, would merit a
volume to itself. Nor do these Titanic orchestral
productions occupy the whole of his attention. They
are accompanied by a mass of works for the pianoforte,
which, if in one sense slighter than those we
have named, yet, in another, stand equally high; the
soliloquies and dialogues (if we may be allowed the
expression) contained in the pianoforte sonatas
breathe thoughts as noble and as deep as those
expressed by the more varied <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i> of
the orchestra or the quartets. Truly, a perfect
acquaintance with Beethoven would claim the devotion
of the highest powers, and the study of a lifetime.
Any attempt, however, to depict these great
works briefly in words would be futile, and we therefore
pass on to the consideration of the poet's outer
life. This was almost monotonous&mdash;certainly not
varied. Beethoven, as we have seen, lived wholly
in his art, and the changes which occurred, most
momentous to him, were not those of outward circumstance,
but of inner, intellectual development.</p>

<p>In the year 1809 he was offered the post of
Kapellmeister to the King of Westphalia, with a
salary of six hundred ducats; and this, his great
desire of possessing a fixed income made him ready
to accept; although he would certainly have been
miserable in such a position, as Jerome was not the
man to understand either him or his works. Happily,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
this ordeal was spared him. It was thought derogatory
to the dignity of Austria that her greatest composer,
the one of whom she had most reason to be
proud, should be allowed through pecuniary considerations
to quit her bounds; and as the Emperor
would do nothing for Beethoven (his abhorrence of
etiquette and well-known republican sentiments
having prevented his ever getting into favour at
Court), an agreement was ultimately entered into by
the Archduke Rudolph (Beethoven's pupil, afterwards
Archbishop of Olm&uuml;tz) and the Princes Lobkowitz
and Kinsky, to pay the composer annually
the sum of four thousand guldens, on condition
of his continuing to reside in Vienna. In two years'
time this was reduced one-fifth, owing to changes in
the Austrian Finance, and subsequently it dwindled
down to a mere nothing, from the death and bankruptcy
of two of the contracting parties&mdash;but Beethoven
could get no redress, although he religiously
fulfilled his part of the compact.</p>

<p>In drawing the money from the executors of
Prince Kinsky he was obliged always to send in
a proof that he was still in existence. This annoyed
him excessively, and he generally had the affair
transacted for him by a friend, which on one occasion
produced the following laconic voucher to
Schindler:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Certificate of Life.</span>&mdash;The Fish lives! <i>vidi</i>
Pastor Romualdus,"&mdash;an allusion to his eccentric use
of water when composing.</p>

<p>In this year also occurred the bombardment of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
Vienna, out of which Ries has contrived to bring
forward an implied accusation of cowardice against
the composer, in his statement that Beethoven hid
himself in a cellar, burying his head among cushions
that he might not hear the firing.</p>

<p>The explanation of this lies on the surface; if he
did take refuge underground it was only what every
other inhabitant of the city, whose duty did not call
him elsewhere, was doing; and as for the cushions&mdash;the
vibration of the cannonade heard in that vault
must have been agony to his diseased nerve. Had
Beethoven really been alarmed he might easily have
quitted Vienna. Cowardice in any form is the last
vice that could be attributed to him; resolute and
firm, he feared no danger.</p>

<p>In 1810 the Mass in C was performed for the first
time at Eisenstadt, the residence of Prince Esterhazy,
the grandson of Haydn's patron, in whose service
Hummel was at the time as Kapellmeister. Esterhazy,
accustomed only to the simple services and
masses of the Haydn-Mozart school, did not know
what to make of a production so totally different.
Accordingly, at the <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i> afterwards given in the
palace to the artists and dilettanti who had assembled
for the occasion, he said, with a smile, to our composer,
"Now, dear Beethoven, what is this that you
have been about again?" The susceptible musician,
not a little irritated at hearing his work so lightly
spoken of, glanced towards Hummel, who happened
to be standing by the Prince's side, wearing a peculiar
smile, which seemed to Beethoven full of mali<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>cious pleasure. This was too much&mdash;the opinion of
a fashionable worldling like Esterhazy was nothing
to Beethoven, but that a brother in art should so
misunderstand him&mdash;should rejoice at an apparent
failure!&mdash;he rose abruptly, and quitted the palace.</p>

<p>Such is the correct account of the rupture between
Beethoven and Hummel, which lasted until a few
days before the death of the former, when Hummel,
hearing of his precarious state, hastened to Vienna to
effect a reconciliation before it was too late.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Another
version of the story is that the two composers were
rivals for the hand of the same lady, and that
Hummel, owing to Beethoven's deafness and his own
better position as Kapellmeister, was the favoured
suitor! The practice of tracing every event in our
composer's life to a love affair is just as ridiculous as
the opposite extreme of denying his capability for the
tender passion.</p>

<p>A more interesting incident in connection with the
First Mass is that related by Schindler of the effect
produced upon Beethoven by the reading of the
German text composed for it by some poet, who,
though unknown to fame, seems to have translated
the master's thoughts from the language of Tones
into that of Words, with power and truth. When<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
Beethoven came to the "<i>Qui tollis</i>" his eyes overflowed
with tears (the first and last time that he was
ever seen so affected) as he exclaimed, "Thus I felt
while composing this!"</p>

<p>The tide of Beethoven's earthly renown and glory,
which had been slowly rising for years, reached its
height in 1813-14.</p>

<p>In the former year took place the two celebrated
concerts on behalf of the Austrian and Bavarian
soldiers wounded in the battle of Hanau, when the
Seventh Symphony, and "Wellington's Victory, or
the Battle of Vittoria," were performed for the first
time. We can easily imagine, from the sensation excited
even now by the latter work, how intense must
have been the enthusiasm which greeted its performance
at a time when popular feeling was strung up to
the highest pitch. Beethoven himself directed, regulating
the movements of his b&acirc;ton by those of Schuppanzigh's
bow. In a notice of the concert written by
himself he says: "It was an unprecedented assembly
of distinguished artists, every one of whom was inspired
by the desire of accomplishing something by
his art for the benefit of the Fatherland; and all
worked together unanimously, accepting of subordinate
places without regard to precedence, that a
splendid <i>ensemble</i> might be attained.... My
part was the direction of the whole, but only because
the music happened to be of my composition. Had
it been otherwise, I would have stationed myself as
readily at the great drum, like Herr Hummel; for
our only motives were Love to the Fatherland, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
the joyful devotion of our powers to serve those who
had sacrificed so much for us."</p>

<p>In 1814 occurred the great Congress, when Vienna
was for a season the abode of kings, princes, and
delegates from every Court in Europe, and the glittering
capital was well-nigh intoxicated by its own
magnificence. The magistrates of the city invited
Beethoven to compose a Cantata for the occasion,
which produced the "Glorreiche Augenblick," perhaps
the composer's most neglected work, and deservedly
so, as it is not worthy of him. It won for
him, however, the presentation of the freedom of the
city, the only distinction which Beethoven valued.
Nor was this his only triumph. His genius began to
be universally recognised; he was created an honorary
member of Academies and Societies in London,
Paris, Stockholm, and Amsterdam; and the Philharmonic
Society in London presented him with a
superb grand pianoforte of Broadwood's manufacture.
In short, from every nation in Europe, and even from
America, he received striking proofs of the love and
admiration in which he was held. Stimulated by
these manifestations, excited by the splendour around
him, and the stirring, momentous events which were
taking place, Beethoven was induced to depart
for the time from his usual solitary habits, and to
mingle for a few weeks in society. In the apartments
of Prince Rasoumowski, the well-known Russian
dilettante, he was introduced to many of the illustrious
visitors, and long retained a lively recollection,
half comical, half gratified, of the manner in which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
he had been idolized;&mdash;how the grand seigneurs had
paid court to him, and how admirably he had played
his part in receiving their homage! He was most
deeply affected by his interview with the gentle
Empress Elizabeth of Russia, with whom he conversed
in his customary frank, open way, completely
setting aside all etiquette; while she, on her part,
expressed the highest veneration for the composer,
and at her departure left him a gift of two hundred
ducats, which he acknowledged after his own fashion
by dedicating to her his brilliant Polonaise, Op. 89.
This was the only substantial result to our poverty-stricken
Beethoven of the attachment professed by
the whole of the gay throng!</p>

<p>The bright episode of the Congress, with its f&ecirc;tes
and triumphs, soon flitted past, bringing out in sterner
and darker contrast the days which followed.</p>

<p>Beethoven had dedicated his "Battle of Vittoria"
to the Prince Regent of England (George IV.), but
to his great chagrin, no notice was taken of it. He
alludes to this in a letter to Ries, and referring to
the Prince's well-known character of <i>gourmand</i>, says,
"He might at least have sent me a butcher's knife or
a turtle!"</p>

<p>Another vexation in connection with the symphony,
causing him infinite annoyance, arose out of the despicable
conduct of Maelzel, afterwards the inventor
of the metronome. In the year 1812 he had made
the acquaintance of the latter, who had promised to
construct for him a sound-conductor, in return for
which Beethoven composed a kind of warlike piece<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
for the mechanician's new instrument, the panharmonica,
which he was on the point of taking to England
for exhibition. The effect of Beethoven's work
was so marvellous, that Maelzel urged him to arrange
it for the orchestra, and the result was&mdash;the "Battle
of Vittoria." Maelzel meanwhile went on constructing
four machines, only one of which was found
available, and Beethoven, without the slightest suspicion
of any underhand dealing, allowed him to
take the entire management of the concerts for the
relief of the wounded. In his hermit life he did not
hear much of what was going on around him, and his
consternation may therefore be imagined when informed
that his false friend was announcing the
symphony everywhere as his own property, stating
that it had been given to him by Beethoven in return
for his machine, and the sum of four hundred guldens
which he professed to have lent him! He had
actually contrived to have many of the orchestral
parts copied out, and those that were wanting supplied
by some low musician, and with this mutilated
work he was on his way to England. The matter was
at once placed in the hands of the law; but it was long
before Beethoven recovered from the effects of this
fraud; it made him, in fact, suspicious ever after
towards copyists. The loan of four hundred guldens
proved to have been <i>fifty</i>, which Beethoven accepted
from him at a time when, as he states in his instructions
to his lawyers, he was "in dire necessity;
<i>deserted by every one in Vienna</i>."</p>

<p>This Maelzel had the impudence subsequently to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
write to Beethoven, requesting his patronage for the
metronome, and pretending that he was busily engaged
in preparing a sound-conductor which would enable
the master to direct in the orchestra. The latter
never made its appearance, but Beethoven, who at
first approved of the metronome, did all in his power
to have it introduced. Afterwards, when he saw the
confusion of <i>tempo</i> which it had occasioned, he used
to say, "Don't let us have any metronome! He
that has true feeling will not require it, and for him
who has none, it will not be of any use."</p>

<p>This affair with Maelzel gives us a glimpse into
the pecuniary difficulties which harassed Beethoven
throughout his life, assuming greater prominence
towards the end. He was always in want of money,
and yet (according to the notions of the times) he was
handsomely paid for his compositions. What, then,
was the cause of it? Were his means swallowed up
by his frequent removals? Did the perplexity arise
simply from his unbusiness-like habits? To these
questions we must add a third, which may, perhaps,
afford a clue to the mystery,&mdash;What became of the
valuable presents, the watches, rings, breast-pins,
snuff-boxes, &amp;c., &amp;c., of which Beethoven had received
so many? When asked where such a gift was, he
would look bewildered, and say after a moment's reflection,
"I really don't know!" The matter would
then pass entirely from his thoughts; but there were
those about him who were not equally indifferent!</p>

<p>In 1815 the cloud which for two years had been
threatening, burst upon him in those troubles and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
sorrows which encompassed him until the end. He
lost his old friend and staunch supporter, Prince Lichnowski,
and, a few months after, his brother Carl, who
in dying bequeathed to him as a legacy the care
of his only child. It seemed as if the annoyance
which this man had caused our Beethoven in his life
were to be perpetuated and continually renewed in
the person of his son. Not so, however, did the
master regard the fresh call upon him. After having
done all that kindness could suggest, or money procure,
to relieve his brother's sufferings and cheer his
last days, he took home the orphan child to his heart
with a love and tenderness that could not have been
greater had the boy been his own.</p>

<p>His first step was to remove him from the care of
his mother, a woman of lax morals and low habits.
In this Beethoven was actuated by the purest and
best motives; but, unfortunately, his zeal went too
far. He forgot that the fact of his sister-in-law's
having been a bad wife did not necessarily imply
that she had lost a mother's heart; and in insisting
upon the total separation between the two, he roused
all the bitterest feelings of a woman's nature, and
prepared much sorrow for himself. The "Queen of
Night," as he nicknamed her, sought redress through
the law, and for four years a suit for the possession
of the lad was pending. In his appeal Beethoven
thus nobly expresses the sentiments which dictated
his conduct:&mdash;"My wishes and efforts have no other
aim than that of giving the best possible education
to the boy, his talents justifying the greatest expec<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>tations;
and of fulfilling the trust reposed in my
brotherly love by his father. The stem is now pliable;
but if it be for a time neglected, it will become
crooked, and outgrow the gardener's training hand;
and upright bearing, knowledge, and character will
be irretrievably lost. I know of no duty more sacred
than that of the training and education of a child.
The duty of a guardian can only consist in the appreciation
of what is good, and the adoption of a right
course; and only then does he consult the welfare of
his ward; whereas in obstructing the good he neglects
his duty."</p>

<p>Misled by the prefix <i>van</i>, his advocate unfortunately
carried the case to the Aristocratic Court; and, as it
went on, Beethoven was called upon to show his right
to this proceeding. Pointing with eloquent emphasis
to his head and heart, the composer declared that in
these lay his nobility; but, however true in the
abstract, the law could not admit this plea, and after
a decision had been given in his favour, the case had
to be re-tried before the ordinary Civil Court. This
occurrence wounded Beethoven more than can be
described; he felt his honour tarnished as a man and
as an artist, and for several months no persuasion
could induce him to show himself in public. In
addition to this, the evidence necessarily brought
forward to strengthen his plea revealed only too
plainly the loose life of his sister-in-law, and such an
<i>expos&eacute;</i> of one so nearly related to himself was, for his
pure and reserved nature, the height of misery.</p>

<p>The Civil Court reversed the decision of the Aris<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>tocratic,
and the boy was given over to his mother;
while Beethoven, determined to gain his end, brought
the case before the High Court of Appeal, where he
was finally successful. Let the reader imagine the
effect of all this painful publicity, following upon the
annoyances with Maelzel, to a mind constituted like
Beethoven's. No Stylites on his pillar could have
suffered more than did our composer in his loneliness
until the cause was gained. And what return did he
meet with from the object of his solicitude?&mdash;The
basest ingratitude.</p>

<p>About this time he began seriously to think of
visiting London; the Philharmonic Society made
him the most handsome offers; and his own inclinations
prompted him to quit Vienna. He had at all
times cherished the greatest love and admiration for
England and the English nation, our free institutions
harmonizing with his political views; and a commission
coming from this quarter was always welcome
to him, not only on account of the unwonted <i>honoraire</i>
which usually accompanied it, but also because
of the high esteem in which he held the English as
artists and appreciators of art. During the latter
years of his life, therefore, this visit to London was
his favourite scheme, and he intended <i>en route</i> to
pass through the Rhine provinces, that he might
once more see the home and the friends of his boyhood;&mdash;but
it was destined never to take place.</p>

<p>The four years of the lawsuit were almost barren
of creative result, but in the winter of 1819-20 he
began his Mass in D. This colossal work, written<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
more for future generations than for us, was originally
intended for the installation of the Archduke Rudolph
as Archbishop of Olm&uuml;tz; but as the work went on,
our composer grew more and more in love with his
task, which gradually assumed such proportions that
it was not completed till 1823&mdash;two years after the
event it was meant to celebrate! A copy of the
Mass, which Beethoven regarded as his most successful
effort, was offered to every court in Europe for the
sum of fifty ducats. It was, however, accepted only
by France, Prussia, Saxony, Russia, and by Prince
Radziwill, Governor of Posen, and a musical society
in Frankfort. The King of Prussia sent to inquire,
through his Ambassador, if the master would not
prefer a decoration to the fifty ducats. Beethoven's
answer was prompt&mdash;"Fifty ducats!" If his work
were worthy of a decoration, why not have given it in
addition to the paltry sum asked for it? Louis XVIII.
acted differently; he sent the composer a valuable gold
medal, on one side of which was his bust, and on the
reverse the inscription, "<i>Donn&eacute;, par le roi, &agrave; M.
Beethoven</i>." An application of Beethoven's to Goethe
requesting him to draw the attention of Karl August
to the Mass met with no answer, although Goethe
might have been able, at very trifling inconvenience
to himself, to render material assistance to the master.
His self-love had probably not recovered from the
shock it had received during a walk with Beethoven
on the Bastei at Vienna, when, struck by the profound
respect and deference manifested by every one whom
they encountered, Goethe exclaimed, "I really had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
no idea that I was so well known here!" "Oh!"
replies our brusque composer, "the people are bowing
to me, not to you!" This was in reality the case, for
the circumstance occurred in Beethoven's palmy
days, when he was, as Marx observes, a "universally
beloved and popular character, a part of Vienna
itself."</p>

<p>The circumstance which more than any other casts
a gloom over the master's last days is, that he was
doomed (apparently) to outlive his fame, and to have
the inexpressible mortification of witnessing that
rupture in the musical world which has lasted down
to our days, and will probably never be healed, viz.,
the separation of the classical from the so-called
romantic school. Hitherto, the followers of Art had
been united; naturally, individual tastes and predilections
had occasionally predominated&mdash;some admiring
one master and some another,&mdash;but on the
whole, the lovers of music had been unanimous in
their adherence to the pure and good. With the
appearance of Rossini (that clever scene-painter, as
Beethoven called him), this state of affairs underwent
a complete revolution. His gay, light-hearted melodies,
extravagant roulades, and inexhaustible vivacity
took the public by storm&mdash;Beethoven and his immortal
masterpieces were forgotten. And yet, perhaps,
this is only what might have been expected,&mdash;the
divine in Art is not for all, nor are all for the
divine. Beethoven might have known, like Goethe,
that he was too profound ever to be popular in a
wide sense. The mass of mankind look upon Art<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
simply as a means of relaxation. So, indeed, it
ought to be to all; but never should it stop
there. Art, in its highest and best forms, has power
not only to provide the weary and careworn with
temporary self-forgetfulness, and to dissipate grief,
but&mdash;and herein lies its true, its God-given strength&mdash;to
renew the energies and brace the mind for
higher and nobler efforts in the future. Whenever
it stops short of this, satisfied with fulfilling its first
and lower function, there is developed a tendency to
abdicate its real position, and to degenerate into the
mere panderer to man's follies, to his vices. Who
could have felt this more keenly than Beethoven?
Not the mere loss of his own popularity was it that
made him turn away so deeply wounded from
grand displays in which snatches of his own works
were performed, along with meaningless arias, and
shallow, noisy overtures of the new Italian school.
So deeply did he take the change to heart, that he
resolved to have his Mass in D and the Ninth Symphony
performed for the first time in Berlin. The
announcement of this intention produced a warm
remonstrance (in the form of an Address) from his
attached little circle of friends; and the master,
touched by the feeling which called out this manifestation,
was induced to forego his determination,
and to consent to the two works being brought out
in Vienna, provided a hall suitable for the purpose
could be obtained.</p>

<p>This was no easy matter, and the difficulties in
connection with it gave rise to a half-comical little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
incident. His enemies were in power, and demanded
an absurd sum for the use of the building, to which
Beethoven could not be induced to agree. As
neither party would yield, the project seemed on
the point of shipwreck, when the faithful Schindler,
alarmed for the success of the enterprise on which
he had set his heart, persuaded Count Moritz Lichnowski
and the violinist Schuppanzigh to meet him
as if by accident at Beethoven's house, and press
the latter to yield to what was inevitable. The plan
succeeded, and the necessary papers were signed;
but the composer's suspicions were roused, and the
three devoted friends received for their pains the
following autocratic mandates:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center">
"<span class="smcap">To Count Moritz Lichnowski</span>,&mdash;
</p>

<p>"Duplicity I despise. Visit me no more. There will
be no concert.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left:23em;" class="smcap">"Beethoven.</span>"<br />
</p></div>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center">
"<span class="smcap">To Herr Schuppanzigh</span>,&mdash;
</p>

<p>"Come no more to see me. I shall give no concert.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left:23em;" class="smcap">"Beethoven.</span>"<br />
</p></div>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center">
"<span class="smcap">To Herr Schindler</span>,&mdash;
</p>

<p>"Do not come to me until I send for you. No concert.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left:23em;" class="smcap">"Beethoven.</span>"<br />
</p></div>

<p>This did not in the least deter them, however,
from doing what they believed necessary for his
benefit: the concert took place, and was the scene
of a triumph such as few have experienced. The
glorious Jupiter Symphony seemed to act upon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
immense mass of human beings that thronged the
building in every part, like ambrosial nectar; they
became intoxicated with delight, and when the refrain
was caught up by the choir, "<i>Seid umschlungen
Millionen!</i>" a shout of exuberant joy rent the air,
completely drowning the singers and instruments.
But there stood the master in the midst, his face
turned towards the orchestra, absorbed and sunk
within himself as usual,&mdash;he heard nothing, saw
nothing. Fr&auml;ulein Unger, the soprano, turned him
gently round, and then what a sight met his astonished
gaze,&mdash;a multitude transported with joy! Almost
all were standing, and the greater number
melted to tears, now for the first time realizing
fully the extent of Beethoven's calamity.&mdash;Probably
in all that great assembly the master himself was
the most unmoved. Simply bowing in response to
the ovation, he left the theatre gloomy and despondent,
and took his homeward way in silence.</p>

<p>Verily, he, like a Greater, knew what was in man.
In eight days from this eventful epoch he was completely
forgotten; a second concert proved an utter
failure, and Rossini's star was again in the ascendant.
Nor did the flighty Viennese public cast another
thought upon our Beethoven until the news of his
death came upon them like the shock of an earthquake,
and they hastened, when it was too late, to
repair the past.</p>

<p>But if it was painful to meet with ingratitude from
the public, how much harder must it have been for
the master to endure the same from one nearly related
to him! We have said that he adopted his brother's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
orphan child. This nephew, also a Carl Beethoven,
was at his father's death about eight years of age, and
a boy of great talent and promise. The four succeeding
years, during which the lawsuit dragged its weary
length, were extremely detrimental to him, as he
seems to have been tossed about from one person to
another&mdash;now with his mother, and again with his
uncle&mdash;in a manner very prejudicial to any good
moral development. Events showed him only too
plainly the character of his mother, but nature&mdash;stronger
still&mdash;urged him to take her part in the
contest so far as he dared; and, incited by her evil
counsels, he soon began secretly to despise his uncle's
authority, and openly to follow a path he had laid
down for himself,&mdash;the path of self-will and sensual
indulgence. Expelled from the University where he
was attending the Philosophical Course, his more
than father received the repentant prodigal with open
arms, and placed him in the Polytechnic School to
study for a mercantile career, that he might be under
the supervision of Herr Reisser, Vice-President of the
Institute, and co-guardian with himself over Carl.
In the summer of 1825 the composer wrote no fewer
than twenty-nine letters to his erring nephew, every
one of which exhibits his character in the most beautiful
light. They breathe the cry of a David, "Oh!
Absalom! my son! my son!"&mdash;but it is a living
Absalom who has to be lamented, and the most
energetic appeals, the most loving remonstrances are
invoked to move that stony heart. In vain,&mdash;Carl
went from bad to worse, and in 1826 the master was
compelled to give up the habit which had been his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
only solace for years&mdash;that of spending the summer
in the country&mdash;and to remain in Vienna to watch
over the young man. Matters soon came to a crisis,&mdash;Carl,
urged to pass an examination which he had
long neglected, attempted, in a fit of despair, to put
an end to his own life. Here the law stepped in, and
after he had been treated in an asylum where his
spiritual as well as his bodily condition was cared for,
the miserable youth was restored to his no less
wretched uncle, with orders to quit Vienna within
four-and-twenty hours. Beethoven's old friend, Stephan
Breuning, exerted himself to procure a cadetship
for the lad, and he was at length permitted to join
the regiment of the Baron von Stutterheim, to whom
the composer gratefully dedicated one of his last
quartets. Pending this arrangement the unhappy
uncle and nephew took refuge at Gneixendorf, the
estate of Johann v. Beethoven, who had offered
them a temporary asylum. A few days here, however,
were enough for the composer; irritated by the
unjust reproaches and low taunts of his brother, he
determined at once to return to Vienna, taking his
nephew with him. It was a raw, cold, miserable day
in December; Johann refused to lend his close carriage
to him to whom he owed all his prosperity, and
Beethoven was obliged to perform a long journey in
an open conveyance, with no shelter from the keen
wind and pitiless rain. His health, which had long
been failing, sank under this exposure, and he arrived
in Vienna with a severe attack of inflammation of the
lungs, which ultimately caused his death.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as they arrived at home, Carl was charged
instantly to procure a physician for his uncle, one
Dr. Wawruch; but this loving nephew's whole
thoughts were for his old companions and his old
haunts. He went to play billiards, entrusting his
commission to the tender mercies of a servant of the
establishment, who, in his turn, let the affair pass
entirely from his memory until two days after, when
he happened to be taken ill himself, and to be
carried <i>by chance</i> to the same hospital in which the
doctor practised. At the sight of the physician his
instructions flashed upon his memory, and he besought
him to go at once to the great Beethoven.
Horror-struck, Dr. Wawruch, who was an enthusiastic
admirer of the composer, hastened to his house and
found him lying in the most precarious state, completely
alone and neglected. His unwearied efforts
so far succeeded that Beethoven rallied for a time,
when his first care was&mdash;to appoint his worthless
nephew sole heir to all his effects! Soon symptoms of
dropsy showed themselves, he had to be tapped four
times, and it became evident that the master spirit
would soon leave its earthly tabernacle for a better
and more enduring habitation. He was always
resigned and patient, remarking, with a smile, when
a painful operation was being performed, "Better
water from my body than from my pen!"</p>

<p>The Philharmonic Society sent him a magnificent
edition of Handel, and the greatest pleasure of his
last days consisted in going through the works of his
favourite composer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>His illness, however, lasted some time; in the
meanwhile he was making nothing, and his small
resources began to fail him. The money he had
recently made by his works he had added to the
fund which he sacredly kept for his nephew, and
which no persuasion could induce him to touch; he
had been disappointed in a sum owing to him by the
Russian dilettante, Prince Galitzin; and in great
distress the question arose, what was he to do? to
whom could he turn? He bethought him of the
offer made by the Philharmonic Society in London
to give a concert for his benefit, and after much
hesitation, finally applied to them, through Moscheles
and Sir George Smart, for the fulfilment of the
promise. His countrymen have never been able to
forgive Beethoven for this step, especially as it was
found after his death that he had left about &pound;1,200;
but this, as we said before, he looked upon as his
nephew's property, and would not appropriate any
of it to his own use&mdash;therefore, what was he to do?
<i>Forsaken by the whole world in Vienna</i>, was he to
starve? The society rejoiced in the opportunity of
showing the gratitude of England to him who has
placed the whole human race under an eternal obligation,
and immediately despatched &pound;100 to Vienna,
with the intimation that if this were not sufficient
more would be forthcoming.</p>

<p>Alas! more was not required; a few days after
the gift arrived the great musician breathed his last.
We leave the description of the closing scene to
Schindler:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"When I went to him on the morning of the 24th
of March, 1827, I found him with distorted face, and
so weak that only by the greatest effort could he
utter a few words. In a short time the physician
entered, and, after looking at him in silence, whispered
to me that Beethoven was advancing with rapid
steps towards dissolution. As we had fortunately
provided for the signing of the will some days previously,
there remained to us but <i>one</i> ardent wish&mdash;that
of proving to the world that he died as a true
Christian. The physician, therefore, wrote a few
lines, begging him in the name of all his friends to
allow the holy sacrament to be administered to
him, upon which he answered calmly and collectedly,
'I will.' The physician then left, that I might
arrange for this; and Beethoven said to me, 'I beg
you to write to Schott, and send him the document,
he will require it; write to him in my name, I am too
weak; and tell him that I beg him earnestly to send
the wine he promised. If you have time to-day,
write also to England.' The pastor came about
twelve o'clock, and the holy office was performed
with the greatest solemnity.</p>

<p>"Beethoven himself now began to believe in his
approaching end; for hardly had the clergyman
gone than he exclaimed, '<i>Plaudite amici, comedia
finita est</i>; have I not always said that it would come
thus?' He then begged me again not to forget
Schott, and to thank the Philharmonic Society once
more for their gift, adding that the society had
cheered his last days, and that even on the verge of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
the grave he thanked them and the whole English
nation. At this moment the servant of Herr von
Breuning entered with the little case of wine sent by
Schott. I placed two bottles of Rudesheimer on the
table by his side; he looked at them and said, 'What
a pity!&mdash;too late!' These were his last words. In a
few moments he fell into an agony so intense that he
could no longer articulate. Towards evening he lost
consciousness, and became delirious. This lasted till
the evening of the 25th, when visible signs of death
already showed themselves. Notwithstanding, he
lingered till the evening of the 26th, when his spirit
took flight, while without a violent storm of thunder
and lightning seemed to reflect his death struggle in
Nature herself&mdash;his best friend."</p>

<p>The last agonies of the master were soothed by but
<i>one</i> friendly touch, that of Anselm H&uuml;ttenbrenner
from Gratz, who had hurried into Vienna to press the
loved hand once more. He was borne to his last
resting-place by an immense concourse, exceeding
twenty thousand; composers, poets, authors, artists,
surrounded his coffin with lighted torches, while the
choristers sang to one of his own melodies the words
of Grillparzer:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left:15em;" >
"Du, dem nie im Leben,<br />
Ruhest&auml;tt ward, und Heerd und Haus,<br />
Ruhe nun im stillen<br />
Grabe, nun im Tode aus,"&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>Thou, who ne'er in life hadst resting-place, nor hearth,
nor home&mdash;rest thee now in the quiet grave&mdash;in
death. Amen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE PIANOFORTE SONATAS
<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor"><span style="font-size:.8em;">[33]</span></a>
</h2>


<p>From Domenico Scarlatti down to Frederic Chopin a
succession of cembalists, clavecinists, and pianists rich in
talent, art, and genius, have created a series of select
works, the counterpart of which, in number, variety, and
lasting fame, can probably be displayed by no other branch
of musical literature. Two collections, however, take
precedence of all this wealth of tone-poetry; these are the
Fugues and Preludes (the "Wohl-temperirte Clavier") of
Johann Sebastian Bach, and the Sonatas of Ludwig van
Beethoven. Both works have been so much discussed,
have been analyzed in so many different ways, have had
such multifarious constructions put upon them, have been
praised and extolled from so many different standpoints,
that the conviction must be impressed upon every observer&mdash;<i>they
are inexhaustible</i>. This is really the case&mdash;they are
an ever-flowing spring of study for the composer and the
pianist, and of enjoyment for the educated hearer. At
present, however, we have only to do with the Sonatas of
Beethoven, and must therefore direct our attention to them.</p>

<p>Most of the German composers have become great at
the pianoforte. They learned to command the technicalities<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
of this compendium of sound, song, harmony, and polyphony,
and it became to them a voice, a second tongue,
a part of themselves. Upon it they could express every
whispering musical emotion, and lend words, we may even
say, to every passing mood which stirred their sensitive
souls; the utterances which Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven
confided to their pianoforte in lonely hours may have
surpassed in beauty (if not in perfection of form) what
they committed to writing. In no other master, however,
does this familiar intercourse between the tone-poet and
his instrument present itself to our minds with such wondrous
clearness as in Beethoven. In his mighty symphonies
he speaks to the crowd like an ideal world's orator, raising
them to the highest emotions of purified humanity; in his
quartets he strives to impart to each instrument an almost
dramatic individuality; but in his Pianoforte Sonatas he
speaks to himself; or, if you will, to the instrument, as to
his dearest friend. He relates his most secret joys and
sorrows, his longing and his love, his hope and his despair.
An entire, full, real, inner human life is revealed to us&mdash;sound,
energetic (<i>kernig</i>), manly. Whether he gives himself
up to passionate outpourings or to melancholy laments,
whether he jests, plays, dreams, laughs, or weeps; he continues
always simple and true. We find no straining after
effect, no oddity, no coquettishness, no sentimentality;
the greatest depth of thought appears unadorned and
unpretentious. There are a few great men who can express
the noblest sentiments without a wish that they should be
heard, and who yet have no cause to dread listeners for
the most trifling thing that they have uttered; and such is
Beethoven in his Pianoforte Sonatas.</p>

<p>We frequently encounter the impression that Beethoven,
in contradistinction to the other loftiest tone-poets, is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
specially the singer of melancholy and sorrow&mdash;of the most
intense, passionate soul-suffering. Nothing can be less
true. Certainly he depicted the night side of the human
mind as no one had done before him. But when we view
his compositions as a whole, there speaks to us out of them
all&mdash;even the last, so deeply furrowed&mdash;a predominating
vigorous cheerfulness, a sympathetic joy, a loving meditativeness,
an earnest, resolute, fresh life. How often he
sinks into blissful dreams, or gives himself up to childlike
merriment! A mature man, yet seized at times by the
extravagance of youth, while the battle of life makes him
earnest, sometimes gloomy, but never faint-hearted or
misanthropic (<i>weltschmerzlich</i>). "He was a <i>man</i>, take him
for all in all;" we have not looked upon his like.</p>

<p>The special application of what has been said to the
separate Sonatas would lead to nothing. Although it is
indisputable that the emotions and frames of mind portrayed
in them are almost infinite in compass, yet it would
be proportionally difficult to express the same with regard
to each single piece in words, the very definiteness of
which would conclusively prove their inadequacy to the
task. It is no empty phrase, however often it may have
been repeated, that Music begins where Language ends,&mdash;of
course with the proviso that the former content herself
with the sovereignty in the domain assigned to her. How
many tone-poems should we be compelled to characterize
by words not only analogous to each other, but having the
very same purport, even though a Goethe's wealth of
language were at our command! and what a dissimilarity
in the tone-forms would notwithstanding be apparent even
to the most uninitiated listener!</p>

<p>Far more important than the invention of characteristic
expressions is it, for those who would devote themselves to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
the study of Beethoven's pianoforte sonatas, to get a clear
idea of them in <i>outline</i> as well as in <i>detail</i>. The comprehension
of them is facilitated by this, with the natural result of
a higher intellectual enjoyment. Is it not elevating to see
how the most daring fancy, after having been nourished by
deep thought, becomes the willing, submissive subject of
the all-regulating mind? Beethoven never lost the reins,
even in what seem the wildest flights of his genius: his
Pegasus may spring up into highest space&mdash;he is able to
direct and guide it.</p>

<p>No earnest, conscientious teacher should neglect to explain
to those entrusted to him the essential nature of the
laws which for centuries, by a kind of natural necessity,
have developed themselves in the forms of instrumental
music. They are so simple that their principal features may
be made clear to the most childish comprehension, and
every step in advance will bring with it a deeper insight.
That Beethoven, in the closest relation to his great predecessors,
submitted to these laws, makes his appearance
doubly great: he did not come to destroy, but to fulfil
the law.</p>

<p>O that our art, the most spiritual of all, were not bound
by so many and such rigorous ties to matter! O that
Beethoven's sonatas were within the reach of all educated
minds, like the lyrics of our great poets! But not this
alone does Nature deny to our art; she withholds from the
greater number of those even who are striving as musicians
and as pianists the full enjoyment of these lofty works, at
least in their totality. They make demands upon the
executants which are not easily met. Here and there we
find the necessary talent. Were it but accompanied by the
indispensable earnestness and diligence!</p>

<p>Beethoven's pianoforte music demands (apart from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
consideration of the extraordinarily difficult works) sound
and solid execution. The first conditions of this are also
the rarest, viz., a powerful and yet gentle touch, with the
greatest possible independence of finger. Beethoven never
writes difficulties merely to win laurels for those executants
who shall overcome them, but neither is he deterred by any
technical inconvenience, if it be necessary to give firm and
clear expression to an idea. Thus we meet, in works
reckoned amongst the easiest, with passages which presuppose
a pretty high degree of technical skill; and since a
pure style properly demands that there shall be at least the
<i>appearance</i> of ease on the part of the performer,&mdash;with
compositions of the intellectual depth of Beethoven's this
is an indispensable qualification. Therefore it is not
advisable to take or place the sonatas of our master in hands
which are not educated for their reception. When that
degree of progress has been attained which will insure the
mastery of the technical difficulties, the enjoyment and
advantage to be derived from their thorough study will be
doubled, and the effort to grasp them intellectually unhindered.</p>

<p>The most essential figures which Beethoven employs are
built upon the scale and the arpeggio. They belong, therefore,
to that style which is specially designated the Clementi-Cramer
school. The studies of these noble representatives
of pure pianoforte playing will always be the best foundation
for the performance of Beethoven's works, and the practice
of them ought to accompany without intermission the study
of the master. Happily, the rich productions of Beethoven's
imagination offer fruits for every epoch of life and of&mdash;pianoforte-playing.
We can reward the diligence of the
studious child by allowing him to play the two sonatinas
published after the master's death, which sound to us rather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
as if they had been written <i>for</i> than <i>by</i> a beginner. But we
should carefully guard against giving to immature young
minds pieces which, though easy in a technical point of
view (and this, after all, is sometimes only <i>apparent</i>), require
a power of conception and of performance far beyond the
demands made upon the fingers. Who, for example, with
any experience in musical life, does not remember having
heard the Sonata Path&eacute;tique played with a <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> of style
which might prove the narrowness of the boundary line
between the sublime and the ridiculous? And similar misconceptions
are met with every day.</p>

<p>We give below a list of the sonatas in the order in which
they ought to be studied, arranged with a view to the
demands made upon the heart and mind, as well as upon
the hand and finger of the performer. It is evident, however,
that this cannot be done with mathematical precision,
and that individual views and capability must, after all,
decide; since <i>difficulty</i> and <i>ease</i> are but relative terms, and
depend in each case upon other and pre-existing conditions.
If, however, our attempt succeed so far as to render the
selection easier to the student, and prevent his making any
great mistakes, we shall not consider our trouble thrown
away.</p>

<p><i>May Beethoven speedily find a home in every house&mdash;in
every heart!</i></p>

<h2>A NOVEL WITH TWO HEROES</h2>

<h3>BY ELLIOTT GRAEME</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Author of "Beethoven; a Memoir," &amp;c.</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>In Two Vols. Post 8vo.</i></p>

<h3>OPINIONS OF THE PRESS</h3>

<p>"We can sincerely congratulate Mr. Graeme on having achieved a
decided literary success.... The story is written in a lively and
agreeable style ... the simple life of the worthy Director is
charmingly told.... Several of the portraits are evidently taken
from life.... The interest of the story centres in Mala, the
beautiful girl, who inherits her father's genius.... The characters
of Mr. Chesney, the stately and somewhat pompous rector, and of his
anti-type, a parson of quite another school, are drawn with singular
truthfulness and freedom from exaggeration."&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>

<p>"Above the average even of good novels ... clever and
amusing ... free from sensationalism, though full of interest,
and of interest which touches many of the deeper chords of life. Mr.
Graeme's delineation of character is remarkably good.... After
all, the English rector is the gem of the book; the crust of his
character so hard, but the ring of the metal itself, though harsh, so
true.... Mr. Graeme's canvas is so crowded, that it is really
difficult to select figures for illustration. When we have given the
notice their prominence demands to some of the leading characters,
we find our heartiest admiration and our keenest dislike really reserved
for the subordinate actors, who yet are very real in the byplay on which
so much of the story turns, as it would turn in actual life."&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i></p>

<p>"In 'A Novel with Two Heroes,' Mr. Graeme has produced a story
of deep interest, and something more,&mdash;he has given us a love-story, or
rather, two or three love-stories, without the least frivolity of the kind
that most of the novel-writers of the day seem to think is the necessary
accompaniment of love-making. He has shown intimate knowledge of
the springs of human nature, and a power of description which is not
the less admirable that it is quiet and unpretentious. There are some
domestic scenes which, for their simplicity and their obvious reproduction
from real life, have not often been excelled; while, again, there are
dramatic scenes powerful almost to painfulness in their intensity, without
being in the least disfigured by big or strong words. Womanly beauty
and natural scenery Mr. Graeme touches with a light hand, contriving
to tell more about them in a few words or lines than most people could
do in as many pages.... Sir Robert Chesney is a good, plucky
English lad, without a serious flaw in him, but not fond of learning,
though full of humour. His experiences with his uncle are delightful....
It would be easy to go through the novel and pick out
passages of high excellence.... Abundant merit of a high order
is shown throughout, alike in construction, plot, and treatment."&mdash;<i>Scotsman.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>"We can only point out some of the beauties of this fresh and
interesting production.... One of its great charms is its singular
purity.... In drawing his characters Mr. Graeme brings out
strongly, yet without the least effort, the pathetic side of most lives;
and he brightens them up at the same time with many a touch of
genuine humour.... Mr. Graeme is no surface painter....
'A Novel with Two Heroes' may safely be recommended to all who
can appreciate delicacy of sentiment, combined with clever portraiture
and thorough knowledge of life."&mdash;<i>Morning Post.</i></p>

<p>"One of the most promising works of fiction which it has been our
lot to encounter of late years. Not for a long time have we read a
more pleasant and enjoyable story, full of poetry and life and music, rich
in subtle delineation of character, vigorous word-painting, and graphic
portraitures, all steeped in that delightful dreaminess and mystic
beauty with which German tales are so often and so richly flavoured....
We have been led to dwell at length on the defects of Mr.
Graeme's work because it is one of those productions which can stand,
and, we shall add, deserve severe criticism. Were the faults a hundred
times more numerous and grave than we have indicated, the novel
would still be a remarkable production. The pictures of German life&mdash;the
St. Cecilian festival, the <i>Fastnacht</i>, or annual Saturnalia at Lent,
the Procession of St. Agnes, the sails on the river, &amp;c., &amp;c., are all
painted with a fidelity and power not often met with but in Scott.
Even more remarkable are the humour and pathos, as well as the variety
and originality of the portraitures. Every character is full of life and
individuality."&mdash;<i>Glasgow Herald.</i></p>

<p>"This work has sterling merits."&mdash;<i>Saturday Review.</i></p>

<p>"Better worth reading than five out of six of the novels of the
day."&mdash;<i>Examiner.</i></p>

<p>"Will be heartily welcomed by all lovers of a good story."&mdash;<i>Graphic.</i></p>

<p>"Uncommon scenes and characters uncommonly well described."&mdash;<i>Illustrated
London News.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Graeme has an eye for colours. He seizes upon the telling
points of a story, and paints in the picturesque details of a passing
scene."&mdash;<i>Westminster Review.</i></p>

<p>"Very lifelike; displays depth and originality of thought."&mdash;<i>John
Bull.</i></p>

<p>"Superior in all respects to the common run of novels."&mdash;<i>Daily
News.</i></p>

<p>"A novel with some delightfully fresh characters; ... not
a page but is attractive."&mdash;<i>Daily Telegraph.</i></p>

<p>"This eminently readable novel ... displays an acquaintance
with human nature, and a power of description of the happiest kind."&mdash;<i>Leeds
Mercury.</i></p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
